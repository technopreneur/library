**Title:** Starting a Fund is NOT for Everyone - YouTube

**Summary:**

- **Host:** Bridget Pennington from Investment Fund Secrets.
  
- **Main Message:** Starting a fund is a significant undertaking and is not for everyone.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. Starting a fund should not be the first business you launch. Prior entrepreneurial experience is beneficial.
2. **Misconceptions:**
   - You don't need a Harvard degree.
   - Prior Wall Street experience of 20 years isn't necessary.
   - No requirement for an elite pedigree or influential family lineage.
3. **Prerequisites for Starting a Fund:**
   - Be skilled at managing money.
   - Hard-working attitude.
   - Possess negotiation skills.
   - Ability to build systems and manage teams.
   - Capability to find and collaborate with excellent partners.
   - Have or partner with someone who has a solid investment strategy.
4. There's an overvaluation of college degrees and the associated "busy work." Some entrepreneurs find success without completing formal education.
5. Not everyone is willing to invest significant time and effort without immediate returns, but this kind of dedication can be essential for launching a successful business.
6. Bridget's mission is to teach how to raise money and build funds, not necessarily investment strategies.
7. Many successful fund managers are regular individuals who had the dedication, skills, and strategy.
8. Engaging with wealthy individuals or potential limited partners can be straightforward; they're regular people.
9. Bridget and her father's experiences show that regular people can launch and manage successful funds. 

**End Note:** The episode emphasizes that while starting a fund isn't for everyone, the right mix of skills and dedication can make it achievable.

hey welcome back to investment fund secrets I'm Bridget Pennington and today we're going to talk about why starting a fund is not for everybody \[Music\] recently I had somebody and a co people ask me this Preston Bridger oh do you really expect average people to come off the street and really start a fund no I don't at all starting a fund is not for everybody starting a fund is like a big deal and that's why we've created there's so much content to create for this because it is a huge deal to go out

and launch a fund I I believe launching a fund should be maybe your second or third business that you've launched you should learn business principles in entrepreneurship before in other places before you come and launch a fund so this this episodes a little bit of a rant but no I don't expect the average person to come off the street and start a fund not at all managing money is a big deal but I think a lot of people have misconceptions on what they need to start a fund and what they don't need to

start a fund and so I want to walk you through a few of my just short list of things that you need and don't need so things that you don't need let's start there you do not need a Harvard degree to start a fund you don't need to work on Wall Street for 20 years to start a fund you don't need some magical pedigree with you know whatever network to start a fund you don't need amazing you know pedigree of your father and grandfather or the Vanderbilts you don't need any of that okay that's a misconception a lot of

people have regular people that are smart and savvy and go through this next list can start funds so the things that you do need though to start funds are this I this is my short list so you need to be first up good at managing money if you're gonna be a professional money manager you should be good at managing your own personal finances right you need to be hard-working it's amazing I was talking to my brother-in-law yesterday we were talking he runs an amazing multi-million dollar business has done really well never went to

college everyone to college for a little bit dropped out and we both are talking about the value the over value that people put on a college degree now college is great you can learn a lot there a lot of networking fantastic things that come from universities but I think a lot of unit we were both agreeing this a lot of university students go and turn their mind off like bridge where you talking about turn your mind off you're at school you're learning you're taking quizzes and stuff yeah you're doing a lot of busy work

right your mind is turned off on your career life decisions and it's turned on oh my got to get those busy work done I got this assignment done I get this test done and it's just busy work to fill your days with sometimes mindless things if you've been to universe like college university you know I'm talking about sometimes mindless stuff of men just memorizing its facts and statistics and things that you're never going to use in life to spit out on a test and you're filling your mind you're not thinking

about hey what am I gonna do when I graduate what am I gonna do in the next 10 years 20 years of my life and career how am I gonna manage my personal investments in finances right a lot of those questions leave your mind when you're at college and it's a sad thing that happens at our college universities is you know people are busy they think being busy is being productive and it's not that way and for a lot of people like I was like my brother MA for him it was just it was just too much mindless

as he had so much focus and could work hard so this isn't for me he stepped out of school and watched a million-dollar multi-million dollar business has done super well anyways working hard is crucial he talks about us all the times like it's very rare he's I thought it was I thought it was just common cuz I was this way is very rare to find someone that's actually willing to wake up and grind for a year without a paycheck that's hard that's hard work when people talk about all hard work

like okay digging ditches is hard work but waking up every day at 6 a.m. and working 12 hours a day for a year without a paycheck that is hard work and a lot of people are not willing to do that to start their own business they're not willing to invest you know two grand or five grand or even 10 grand on themselves but they'll invest 80 grand on a mindless degree for a piece of paper that just kept them busy during the most probably could be the most productive years of your life right you don't have kids you don't have a spouse

right usually in college you have time to go launch businesses and take risks right as we're talking about last night and it's very few people actually we've found that are willing to put in the works of you first off good at managing money hard worker I put on their negotiation skills you're able to build systems and manage teams if you're able to find amazing partners and work with those partners well and if you have an amazing investment those are the things you need to start a fund you don't need to work on Wall

Street you don't to go to Harvard but you do need to be able to build systems manage teams bring people together be an organizer be the the system builder have a great investment strategy coupled with that and maybe you partner with somebody that has that those are things that you need to start a fund we had a lady on our support she she asked us Bridger it how how what kind of return can I expect from coming in your course and we sell a you know simple right now it's a simple forty seven dollar course and I she said

what kind of return on my investment can I expect and we just said sorry I just don't think this is for you right we just said no you're not allowed to come in because we are actively and people might say wow why don't you let her in what are you doing I am actively keeping people out of our programs and content just as much as I'm actively bringing them in now that might you make you pause for a second why would you do that because there are people certain people I do not want in our courses and

programs with our coaching because they are so just as such a hassle and burden on support on me to help them right out I would rather not take your money just keep your own money do you know go somewhere else we don't want you in our programs if you have that mindset of what you know exactly Bridger what's the return on my investment that I can expect from you I'm just like sorry this isn't for you and that might be harsh but it saves us a ton of time and it brings we want to bring in the right

type of people a lot of the content I create I try to be polarizing with it because I want to kick out a lot of people that I don't want to work with and I want to bring in and attract people that think like me that are good at the things I just talked about hard-working negotiating building systems bring people and that's what I try to teach and share because that's what's been successful in my fund been launching my fund so with this I you know no hard feelings I love you but a lot of people were trying to actually

kick out to just to take you know burdens off our support and off of our you know content and we don't want to work with some people so starting a fund is not for everybody but if you're hard-working if you have good negotiations if you can build systems in teams and bring people together and have that drive starting a fund is a very very lucrative way to make money we kind of kind of went through our mission statement my mission is to help you design and build very lucrative funds for yourself and your family and

your team that's what all I'm trying to do I'm helping you design a fun I'm not gonna give you an investment strategy right that's for you to figure out but I'll give you a few ideas but I'm gonna teach you how to raise money and build a fund those are the two things I'm focusing on and all my content to do that to help you create a super lucrative fund and that's what we're trying to do here on this podcast and our show and our all of our products we sell and everything like that that's

that's our whole purpose and goal is to do that so starting a fund is not for everybody but it's for a lot of people that you know they didn't work on hot Wall Street they'd had this misconception this false belief that man I didn't come from the Vanderbilt family I'm not a Trump so I can't start a fund that's ridiculous there are thousands of funds in America right now launched and created by just regular seemingly regular Joe's that were just good at managing money good at negotiation good

at finding deals good investment strategy and good at building teams right that's it and it's funny I actually have an opportunity every week I go and we have an entrepreneurship lecture series class we hold at a university and I get to work with them and we have these amazing entrepreneurs coming there I mean they've either sold businesses for hundreds of millions of dollars where they're currently running businesses that are worth hundreds millions of dollars and these guys come on I get to spend five hours with them

every week we talk we have like a little pre thing at the end we talk we have like some food and stuff and I gotta meet these people and talk to them and it's incredible just how much of just regular people they are right I think it's something that we often forget when we're pitching like limited partners that are gonna be super big investors there's regular people these are all regular people just trying to do you know to support their family they're trying to make some money there maybe

trying to get they have a few things they want to leave a legacy maybe they want to get maybe some PHA maybe there's want to make more money whatever it is but there's regular people like all of us right they if they put their pants on one leg at a time just like me and you right and I get to spend you know a lot of hours with people that are very wealthy and rich and we joke and laugh just like I'm talking with you know my cousin from Canada or you know my my buddy from down the street we I mean we

bout the same conversations we're talking about sports and politics and religion and whatever it is right it's not as crazy as you think to start a fund so I hope this episode is a little bit of a rant a little bit of a you know one off on on some support tickets we've had but I want you to know that's that's where we're coming from with this episode and I hope that you know that you can do this I was able to start to find my dad if you heard his story I mean contact great of a resume right

now runs a twenty billion dollar fund and a lot of the fund managers that I'm trying to bring on this show are the same way regular people that decided to work hard could set up say I can build a system I'm not the smartest guy but I can bring the pieces together and launched a fund I hope that gives you confidence in launching your funds so anyways love you all and I'll see you next episode peace
