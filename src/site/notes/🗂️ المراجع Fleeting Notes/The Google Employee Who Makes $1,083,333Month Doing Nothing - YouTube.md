today this man makes 13 million dollars a year which is 1 million eighty three thousand three hundred and thirty three dollars a month all while doing nothing and that's because over the last 20 years he's built 13 Google workplace plugins that have collectively been downloaded over 50 million times these are shocking numbers so I spent the last few weeks devouring every piece of content ever made about it and what I found surprised me for someone so prolific his life is not so different than many of us why did he

nickname his son Google of all the cities in the world why does he live in Agra a couple miles from the Taj Mahal and why is he the only software engineer in his entire company in this video we'll dive into Amit agarwal's early life the beginnings of his blog and his entire plug-in Empire all threaded together by one of the biggest companies in the world Google and google.

com is also where this Story begins I randomly came across amit's article titled this YouTube video has end views how the video title updates itself in response to Tom Scott's insanely viral video his guide discussed Google app scripts a relatively unknown technology that became amidst Secret Sauce it was the first of many links that piqued my curiosity so I did what any normal person would do I Googled the man amit's Life Begins no differently than that of most other Indian families he was born to a business middle class family in

Agra a small City in the Indian state of uttar Pradesh you might know it as the home of the world famous Taj Mahal he attends Saint Peter's College and all boys private school where instead of computers he's fascinated by mathematics and when deciding what to pursue for the rest of his life bases his decision on two factors passion and impact he chooses the oldest engineering institution in India IIT roorkee some 200 miles away and it's his chance to do something bigger than just return home and join the family business the 23

Indian Institute of Technologies are notoriously difficult to get into where after acing multiple exams you also have to have a sufficiently high all India rank amongst your peers to get the subjects of your choice but Amit has no trouble and declares his major as computer science engineering one of the most competitive courses just as in high school by the end of his first year he's consistently at the top of his class his curiosity and enthusiasm for mathematics and science doesn't end either and he

recalls when I got a computer my interest was not towards coding but on the software installation side today also I'm pretty much doing the same thing fast forward to his senior year of college in 1998 when Amit is interning at the maruti factory on inventory management he remembers we had shared emails and with only two computers in the library we had to wait for a long time to get a chance to work on the system or check emails Amit didn't know it then but he would one day become the man who disrupted the entire Google

Suite of products starting with email when Amit graduated in 1999 with his bachelor's in computer science he joins his first and only corporate job at Wilco an I.T company in samajikoda watch commercial center Wilco later became ADP Amit spent the next five years as a software engineer on database systems he managed clients like Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch and then in just two years was promoted to manager he had a career others would kill for a comfortable life and plenty of growth opportunities but

then he gives it all up and quits why well the answer is actually quite simple Amit just takes a big bet to be closer to family Amit abandons the bustling Tech scene in Hyderabad and moves back to Agra 800 miles away and this is where everything changes for him in many ways where amit's real Story begins he has no portfolio because all of his work at ADP is confidential so to Market himself to all the companies around the world especially in the United States and Europe he creates a public-facing brand a website on the world wide web and

that's how his blog digital inspiration is born in 2004 Amit publishes his first blog post ever a review on an HP printer he's recently bought and suddenly the article is getting views first it's hundreds of new visitors and then thousands as he continues to post anywhere from three to seven times a day he starts to see engagement people are returning day after day commenting their questions and reactions though Amit has always hated the word influencer and now even the word blogger because of all

these commercials involved in it so I prefer being called need for a technical writer but not a blogger that is essentially who he is soon other blogs start taking notes one of the biggest ones being Daisy pundit a Blog aggregator that would share the best Snippets of the day from other sources imagine daily dose of Internet your daily dose of internet but in written form Desi pundit has since shut down but at its prime in 2005 was sticking up amid stories giving them new audiences and a sense of legitimacy and

it was working digital Inspirations viewership numbers were skyrocketed so how do I know whether the blog was picking up the primary reason was like I could see the engagement on my blog a year after launching digital inspiration is finally making money almost entirely through Google AdSense Amit no longer has to call advertisers asking them if they want to pay for some Prime real estate on his website instead he embeds a few lines of HTML code and this is the beginning of a lifelong relationship with Google he becomes an outspoken

supporter of AdSense tweeting about it writing how-to articles and even submitting a video to the story contest hi this is Amit agrawal and I write a technology blog called digital inspiration that's monetized using Google AdSense he doesn't end up winning but gets an honorable mention on the official Google Blog in this video published December 2nd 2007 we can see a blurred out AdSense check with the exchange rate at the time being 40 Rupees to one dollar one million thirty thousand two hundred and ninety some

rupees means Amit was clearing 20 twenty five thousand dollars a month a mere three years after starting his blog his NDTV interview sometime around June of 2008 confirmed these numbers so Amit is working harder than ever and putting in many more hours than he did at his corporate job he writes about tech but Loosely with the titles of Articles often being whatever he's interested in at the time everything from Guides to hacks to even a Google Maps interface where you could pin your location all this while the software

engineer at Amit is clear to see even back in 2008 he offered a mobile version of his blog after a few years of blogging Amit realizes the world is changing I think blogging is an extremely competitive field and it's getting harder and harder to attract viewers let alone convince them to subscribe to your content to cement his future Amit starts making moves money moves at first he hacks together side projects just for fun many of which live on Twitter his favorite social media I'm a huge fan of these sites as I try to

catch up with updates from my Twitter and Facebook friends he creates tall tweets a way for you to write tweets that were more than 140 characters long before threads ever existed the program would automatic if we break your tweets up and add little chapter annotations to preserve chronology then he goes viral with sleeping time an application that could guess when famous people went to sleep by analyzing their last 1 000 public tweets over the years he's also created many more Twitter add-ons including tweets forever Twitter

assistant and various other Twitter Bots but none of these toy side projects come even close to the next line of plugins um it will build they'll change his life in ways he couldn't have even imagined it all starts with a friend he recalls one of my friends was facing issues with the call booking I thought of making the required Fields autofill to solve this problem when I released it for the public travel agents across the country purchased it and it's used extensively now Amit starts building for other

people just like him he starts with mail merge a way for you to send the same email but personalize to thousands of different people today there are many third-party apps that can do this but many people want these capabilities natively in Gmail and this strategy of leveraging an existing platform would help differentiate Amit from his competitors mail merge along with every single plug Amit has ever created functions on a freemium Model the free tier has restrictions like watermarks and usage limits but for full access you

can subscribe and pay a yearly amount per user the rest of the internet starts getting a taste of omit's success and on July 1st 2012 all of Amit sites get hacked he posts on Twitter and then goes radio silent plenty of people speculate what happened but no one knows for sure eventually on August 2nd 2012 Amit tweets again deer hacker what you did on 7-1 proved to be a blessing in disguise July was the best ever for digital inspiration and soon after his sights are back up the reference tweet is no longer active but we can only imagine

that the extra publicity and news coverage brought many more people to Amit sites all this while Amit is spending zero dollars in advertising relying instead on organic Word of Mouth through his blogs and YouTube channel and it's working each of his products get millions of downloads and paying customers with the gears in motion amit's life falls into a simple routine much of which he walks us through in His Life in a Day video it in this little snapshot of amit's life we can see him surrounded by his wife and two kids the

eldest of which he's nicknamed Google it's hard to say why that nickname but if amit's past is any clue then it must be his adoration for AdSense Google custom search engine and Google app scripts he loves Google and Google loves him Microsoft followed suit naming him the most valuable professional for five years in a row maybe it's time for Amit to nickname his youngest son Microsoft over the years Amit continues building products used by iconic companies like Airbnb LinkedIn Disney and the US

Embassy while Ahmed worked on apps for Enterprise customers he didn't forget about social good initiatives on May 1st 2021 in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic that had killed over 250 000 people in India Amit created a program that would alert you by email when there were new vaccine doses available near you the initiative garnered national news and he ended up on TV yet again the craziest part of amit's story is not even his success it's the fact that he was a one-man Army using JavaScript

react node Gatsby Docker in the Google Cloud platform Amit single-handedly wrote every single line of code carried out every customer support conversation and marketed his company all over the internet all while having time to answer questions on stack Overflow the true markings of a programming God when asked why he's done his entire career solo um it says if probably if I had grown a team if I had more people working for it it would have grown even more and still the no regrets I guess and that's Amit

Story the man the myth the legend he did what he loved surrounded by those who loved him and there's no better way to end this story than in his own words in between all the work few cups of coffee hush and rush I still managed to capture few moments happy memories thanks \[Music\]
