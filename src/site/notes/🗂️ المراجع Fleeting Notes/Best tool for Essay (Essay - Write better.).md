Bottom LineEditing tools today tell you what's wrong and what to write, but they don't tell you why it's wrong or how to write better in the first place. Auto-correct, auto-suggestion, and grammar correction tools are useful, but they hinder our ability to think, and fall short of turning us into powerful communicators.Essay helps you move beyond the fear of the blank page so you can finally put your ideas down on paper. Then, it helps you move them around and change them, word by word, sentence by sentence, and paragraph by paragraph, rejecting what doesn't work and keeping what's great. In the end, what you're left with is your incredible ideas, powerfully written.

The Creation PhaseBuild the blueprintBefore you begin writing, form a foundation. This will ultimately guide your work and bring you back to focus each time you start to stray.Then, write a bad draft. Quit worrying whether you have written a good sentence and let the ideas flow. The editing comes later!

The Editing PhaseFind the best versionZero in on each sentence and play with your ideas. Those seven versions of a single sentence that you wrote down somewhere? Keep them inline, hide them until youâ€™ve decided on the best version.

Order the chaosRewriting sentences will often change their meaning. Those sentences may now be better suited to different parts of your essay or paragraph. Quickly see all of your sentences broken down line by line, and drag them to easily reorder.

Bird's eye viewTake a step back and look at each section of your writing. Are your arguments still in logical order? Review your work at the paragraph and outline levels.
