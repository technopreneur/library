> Traditional linear reading is highly inefficient. This comes from the fact that various pieces of the text are of various importance. Some should be skipped. Others should be read in the first order of priority. Old-fashioned books are quickly being replaced with hypertext. Hypertext will help you quickly jump to information that is the most important at any given moment. Hypertext requires a different style of writing. All linear texts can assume that the reader is familiar with the preceding sections. This makes them context-poor. Within hypertext, individual texts become context-independent, and all difficult terms and concepts are explained primarily with additional hyperlinks. In the same way in which the web helped delinearize the global sources of information, SuperMemo can help you delinearize your reading of whatever linear material you decide to import to SuperMemo. While reading with SuperMemo, you will see a linear text as a sequence of sections subdivided into paragraphs and individual sentences. SuperMemo will help you provide a separate and independent processing for each section, paragraph or sentence.

> ## What is incremental reading?
> 
> Incremental reading is a learning technique that makes it possible to [read thousands of articles at the same time](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Can_you_really_read_thousands_of_articles_at_the_same_time? "Incremental learning") without getting lost. Incremental reading begins with importing articles from electronic sources, e.g. the Internet. The student then extracts the most important fragments of individual articles for further review. Extracted fragments are then converted into questions and answers. These in turn become subject to systematic review and repetition that maximizes the long-term recall. The review process is handled by the proven *[spaced repetition algorithm](http://super-memory.com/english/ol/background.htm)* known as the [**SuperMemo method**](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo").

> **Incremental reading converts electronic articles into durable knowledge in your memory.** This conversion requires minimum keyboard&mouse work:
> 
> -   **Input**: electronic articles (e.g. collected from the net)
> -   **Output**: well-remembered knowledge (quizzed regularly in the form of questions and answers)
> 
> In incremental reading, you read articles in small portions. After you read a portion of one article, you go on to a portion of another article, etc. You introduce all important portions of texts into the learning process in SuperMemo. This way you do not worry that you forget the main thread of the article, even if you return to reading months later. Your progress with individual articles may be slow, but you greatly increase your efficiency by paying less attention to less important articles and spending more time on articles that are more beneficial to your knowledge. Difficult articles may wait until you read easier explanatory articles, etc. Last but not least, incremental reading increases your efficiency because it is fun! You never get bored. If you do not like an article, you read just a sentence and jump to other articles. This way your attention and focus stay maximized.

> **Warning!** Incremental reading may seem complex at first. However, once you master it, you will begin a learning process that will surpass your expectations. You will be surprised with the volume of data your memory can process and retain! See this [simple demo at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoQoeK53bP8).
