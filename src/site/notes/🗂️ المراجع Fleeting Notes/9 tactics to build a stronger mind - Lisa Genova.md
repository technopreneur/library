1) My name is Lisa Genova. I am an author and neuroscientist. The name of my book is "Remember: The Science of Memory and the Art of Forgetting.
2) Stress causing increased.


- People are worried about their memory.

If you're forgetting to show up

for your four o'clock meeting,

or you forgot the actor
who played Tony Soprano

in the HBO series 'The Sopranos.'

"Can't remember that
guy's name, what is it?"

A lot of us tend to blame ourselves.

This absent-mindedness is
a sign of mental weakness,

or a failing memory,
or a lack of character,

but 99% of forgetting
that happens to all of us,

is normal.

So there are things that we can do

to be less afraid, less panicked,

to have a better relationship
with our memory today-

because forgetting is a
normal part of being human.

My name is Lisa Genova.

I am an author and neuroscientist.

The name of my book is
"Remember: The Science of Memory

and the Art of Forgetting."

So how do we reinforce our memories?

How do we make our memories
stronger, resilient to time,

so that we can recall them decades later?

The first essential ingredient
in creating a memory

that's going to last longer
than this present moment

is attention.

If I put my glasses down

and don't give it a moment's attention

to notice where I've put this,

I can't remember where they
are because I never formed

that memory to begin with.

Your brain will never remember

what you don't pay attention to.

Chronic stress is really
bad for our memory.

Stress hormones mobilize your
brain and body to respond,

to fight, to flee, to react quickly-

not to think.

Stress is meant to be an acute, quick,

on and off phenomenon.

So what happens in your brain and body

if you're exposed to
chronic, unrelenting stress,

and how does that affect your memory?

Under chronic stress, your
body will just keep dumping

adrenaline and cortisol,
and it can't shut off.

This is bad for memory.

You are actually shrinking
your hippocampus-

the part of your brain that's essential

for forming consciously-held memories

is going to be smaller.

You'll be inhibiting 'neurogenesis,'

the birth of new neurons.

The very good news about all of this,

because I've probably
just scared everyone,

is that there are things that
we can do to combat stress.

This is where things
like yoga, meditation,

mindfulness, and exercise come into play.

All of these have been shown

to restore the size of
people's hippocampus

who have been chronically stressed.

A quick word on meditation:

A lot of people are
intimidated by meditation.

They sort of know that this
is probably good for them

in lots of ways, but maybe
don't know how to do it.

Here's a nine-second meditation

to help restore your cortisol levels,

and to help save your hippocampus

and your ability to remember.

Close your eyes if you can.

Breathe in through your
nose to the count of four.

Hold it for a second, and then
breathe out through your nose

to the count of four.

And notice how you feel.

Here's what's going on:

Stress response causes
you to breathe like this-

By breathing slowly in
and out through your nose,

you are telling your brain
and body that you are safe.

We also wanna get enough sleep.

Sleep is not a state of doing nothing

where you're unconscious
and it's a waste of time.

You're very biologically
busy while you sleep,

and there are a number
of super-important things

that are going on in your
brain with respect to memory.

For example, if I got a horrible
night's sleep last night,

I'm gonna wake up today
and my frontal lobe

is gonna have a hard time
dragging itself to its day job-

and one of its most important
jobs is paying attention.

And if I can't pay attention
to what's going on today,

what am I not gonna be
able to do well today?

Form new memories.

Also, your hippocampus
consolidates the information

you're learning into a lasting memory

that you can consciously
retrieve while you sleep.

So what happens if you
don't get enough sleep?

Your hippocampus might
not have had enough time

to do the job, and so your memories

from what happened yesterday and the stuff

you learned yesterday, might
not be fully formed today,

or they might not be formed at all.

Caffeine is actually good for memory,

because caffeine increases your attention.

So anything that's an attention booster

is gonna be a memory booster.

We know that sleep is super
important for forming memories,

so caffeine's good for memory.

You just wanna be careful

that it's not compromising your sleep.

Our brains are not designed
to remember people's names.

These are abstract concepts.

They live in neurological cul-de-sacs.

Ultimately, there's only
one way into that house

that lives at the end of that street,

and there's no other way to get there.

So can we supply more
associations to the person's name

to give us a chance?

In psychology, this is called
the 'Baker-Baker Paradox.'

If I'm trying to remember your name

and your name is Mr. Baker,

that's really tough for me to remember-

abstract concept.

But if I were asked to
remember the word "baker,"

I can picture him wearing an apron,

and he's got flour on his face and,

"Oh, I remember the bakery
I used to love as a kid

and we used to get
danishes there on Sundays."

So now I've got all of these
associations in my brain,

attaching to that word "baker,"

and gives me a chance to hook into it.

For all of these memories,
they benefit from repetition.

The more we repeat, the more we practice,

the more we rehearse a memory,

we are strengthening
those neural connections,

making that neural circuit stronger,

and more likely to be fully retrieved.

One of the ways that
we can repeat a memory

is by writing it down.

If I've experienced a certain
number of things today,

and I keep a journal-

what I've chosen to write down

will become a stronger, more
reinforced memory in my brain.

I will also have the
opportunity to revisit

that memory by reading it later.

So many people come up to
me, so worried, saying,

"If I don't write what
I need to do later down,

I'm gonna forget to do it.

That's gotta mean I'm
getting Alzheimer's."

And I tell all of them, "No,
it's your prospective memory.

It's terrible.

It's not cheating to write it down.

It's actually good practice."

Airline pilots do not rely on their brains

and their prospective memories

to remember to lower the wheels
before landing the plane.

They outsource the job to
a to-do list, a checklist.

We should all write it
down, put it in your phones,

put it in your calendar
alerts, make to-do lists.

If you wanna remember to pick
up milk at the grocery store,

write it down.

Another way to better
remember this information

has to do with self-testing.

If I'm trying to consolidate
something into memory,

and I'm only putting the information in,

I'm traveling one way on the neurons.

If I then try to recall the information,

I'm pulling the information out-

now I'm going the other way.

Going over those circuits
in both directions

will help reinforce and
make that memory stronger.

Okay, having a word stuck
on the tip of your tongue

is a normal glitch in memory retrieval.

It's just a byproduct of how
our brains are organized.

So looking up a word, Googling a word

that's on the tip of your
tongue isn't cheating.

It will not cause digital amnesia.

It will not make your
memory weaker in any way.

It frees you up.

We can Google anything
that we can't remember

in a moment's notice, and
then use that information

to continue thinking, to
continue the conversation,

to learn more.

You have my permission to
Google it and look it up.

What I would love for you to
take away from all of this

is that your memory is amazing.

It is limitless in what
it's capable of remembering

if you supply it with the
right kind of information,

if you supply it with the

right kind of tools and associations.

And it's wildly imperfect,

and that's just the price
of owning a human brain.

Forgetting is a normal
part of being human.
