[![book designer](http://theworldsgreatestbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/calligraphy-131.jpg "book designer")](http://theworldsgreatestbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/calligraphy-131.jpg)B**ook de­sign** is a lost art. Though book de­sign dis­cus­sions usu­ally focus on cov­ers, con­sider how much more time a reader spends star­ing at the text. An el­e­gant book block is just as im­por­tant. Decades ago, pro­fes­sional trades­men prac­ticed the fine art of [type­set­ting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting "typesetting"). Today, book de­sign is often ex­e­cuted (pun in­tended) by am­a­teurs. As easy as it is to set type, many fine points of ty­pog­ra­phy are com­monly over­looked. For­tu­nately, for the de­sign-aware, dig­i­tal tools like [Adobe In­De­sign](http://www.adobe.com/InDesign "Adobe InDesign") make it pos­si­ble to pro­duce pages that as­pire to the old stan­dards of hot metal type.  This is the first of a se­ries of ar­ti­cles of­fer­ing book de­sign tips to help pol­ish your pages.

Sac­ri­fic­ing com­fort­able mar­gins is un­for­tu­nately a good busi­ness de­ci­sion, even if it’s a bad de­sign de­ci­sion. As the book in­dus­try has grown, page mar­gins have shrunk. Text is packed ever more tightly onto the page. Why? A big pub­lisher may print 30,000 copies of a new au­thor’s book. That’s a huge fi­nan­cial risk. If more text can be fit on each page, the print run uses less paper and less ink, re­sult­ing in huge sav­ings.

For­tu­nately, self-pub­lish­ers don’t have this prob­lem be­cause [print-on-de­mand](http://theworldsgreatestbook.com/stop-picking-on-pod "Stop Picking on POD") (POD) al­lows for the pro­duc­tion of one book at a time. Using clas­sic mar­gins and print­ing a few more pages per book adds neg­li­gi­ble cost while giv­ing POD pub­lish­ers a com­pet­i­tive edge.

### **Book De­sign Tip**: Mar­gins

**Page Mar­gins** make a dif­fer­ence be­cause cer­tain shapes and pro­por­tions are nat­u­rally pleas­ing to the eye. These have pro­vided a his­tor­i­cal back­bone for clas­sic ar­chi­tec­ture and were adopted by type­set­ters as early as the 1400s. A page with a well-pro­por­tioned and well-po­si­tioned block of text is per­ceived to be at rest. Re­mov­ing ten­sion from the de­sign al­lows the reader’s focus to re­turn to the mean­ing of the text.

**Wider Mar­gins** not only bring vi­sual har­mony to the page, they pro­vide space for those who like to an­no­tate the text and a place for read­ers to rest their thumbs with­out cov­er­ing up the words.

**Line Width** is an­other im­por­tant book de­sign con­sid­er­a­tion. We read by tak­ing in groups of 3-4 words at a time. The av­er­age book has 2-4 word groups per line. Text set in wide line widths be­comes dif­fi­cult to read be­cause it’s more dif­fi­cult for the eye to keep track of where it is in the text. That’s why news­pa­pers use nar­row, sin­gle columns; to fa­cil­i­tate faster and eas­ier read­ing. The re­la­tion­ship be­tween mar­gins and line width is ob­vi­ous; wider mar­gins mean nar­rower line width. The rule of thumb is 65 char­ac­ters per line, but ideal length can vary with choice of type­face and with the writ­ing it­self. Writ­ers who use long words or lan­guages like Span­ish or Ger­man can find their work frag­mented by dozens of un­wanted hy­phens if type­face, type size and mar­gin sizes aren’t bal­anced.

**White Space** lets a de­sign “breathe.” Seen as a sin­gle unit, a block of text has a cer­tain den­sity. Viewed out of focus, it ap­pears as a dark gray rec­tan­gle within the white rec­tan­gle of the page. Dark and light areas of the page should be in har­mony. If the page is too dense, it feels heavy; the page cre­ates ten­sion. Ul­tra­w­ide mar­gins feel lux­u­ri­ous and are often used in ad­ver­tis­ing de­sign, but they don’t do much to help with the prac­ti­cal task of get­ting enough text on the page to ef­fi­ciently and ef­fec­tively con­vey the mean­ing of the text. Bal­anced book de­sign is im­por­tant.

Ac­cord­ing to Richard Hen­del in *[On Book De­sign](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Design-Mr-Richard-Hendel/dp/0300075707/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1318588501&sr=1-1),*

In books of text meant for con­tin­u­ous read­ing, fac­ing pages should be po­si­tioned in re­la­tion to each other such that the reader thinks of them as a sin­gle unit. The gut­ter mar­gin—the mar­gin by the spine—is there­fore smaller than the front mar­gin—the mar­gin op­po­site the gut­ter, so that the two fac­ing blocks of text are close to­gether and the space to the out­side of them is greater. The top mar­gin is smaller than the bot­tom mar­gin, which is the largest of all. The large bot­tom mar­gin is an­other of those con­ven­tions of ideal Re­nais­sance pro­por­tion that we now think of as rules. The text block that sits square in the cen­ter of the page can look ar­bi­trar­ily placed. Books with large top mar­gins and small bot­tom mar­gins some­times feel as though they have met with some mishap at the bindery.

Ty­pog­ra­phers have de­vel­oped sev­eral **Canons of Page Con­struc­tion.** Many have ar­rived at sim­i­lar con­clu­sions by dif­fer­ent means. Though it’s dif­fi­cult to ex­plain why one specif­i­cally pro­por­tioned rec­tan­gle is more uni­ver­sally pleas­ing to the eye than an­other, cen­turies  of suc­cess­ful ap­pli­ca­tion sup­port the idea. A com­mon form for clas­sic art and ar­chi­tec­ture is the “[golden ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio "Golden Ratio")” of 1:1.618. To im­ple­ment the golden ratio, sim­ply cre­ate a rec­tan­gu­lar box in your draw­ing or page lay­out pro­gram 1 inch wide x 1.618 inches tall. Scale the rec­tan­gle up pro­por­tion­ately to pre­serve the re­la­tion­ship be­tween width and height

The J.A. **Van de Graaf Canon** is a book de­sign based on the “golden ratio” and a sur­vey of me­dieval man­u­scripts. It works for any page size, and en­ables the book de­signer to po­si­tion the text body in a spe­cific area of the page. The black, an­gled lines pro­vide in­sights into the geom­e­try Van de Graaf used to po­si­tion the red text blocks but in today’s dig­i­tal world, things are eas­ier. [Down­load the SVG](http://goo.gl/qhsZM) file or the [high-res­o­lu­tion PNG file](http://goo.gl/YIKLo), im­port the de­sign into a two-spread mas­ter page and ad­just mar­gins ac­cord­ingly.

The great ty­pog­ra­pher, Jan Tschi­chold, pro­posed a sim­pler set of guides for po­si­tion­ing and siz­ing a golden rec­tan­gle on the page. The re­sults of **Tschi­chold’s Golden Sec­tion Canon** are iden­ti­cal to the Van de Graaf Canon but much eas­ier to con­struct by draw­ing a few guide lines on the page.

Tschi­chold’s Golden Sec­tion Canon

When plan­ning mar­gins, re­mem­ber that a book spread isn’t flat. A cer­tain amount of paper will dis­ap­pear into the gut­ter where the pages are at­tached to the book’s spine. Even when fol­low­ing stan­dard print­ers’ guide­lines (Light­ning Source spec­i­fies ¾ inch mar­gins all around the page), I like to move my text boxes an extra 1/8” out­ward from the gut­ter. Though this would seem to go against the con­ven­tion of hav­ing larger out­side mar­gins than in­side mar­gins, enough of the in­side is swal­lowed by the gut­ter to make up the dif­fer­ence.

Of course, not all book de­sign needs such spa­cious mar­gins or for­mu­laic ap­proaches. Be­fore you type­set your book, drop a text box full of sam­ple text into a page spread. Play with mar­gin spec­i­fi­ca­tions until you achieve a bal­ance that works.

### **Book De­sign Tip: Lead­ing**

**Lead­ing** (pro­nounced “led­ding”) is the ty­pog­ra­pher’s word for line spac­ing, named for the lead shims that were once in­serted be­tween rows of type­set char­ac­ters. Pos­si­bly, you have played with the con­trols in your word proces­sor and seen how text looks with sin­gle or dou­ble line spac­ing se­lected? Man­u­scripts are gen­er­ally cre­ated dou­ble-spaced, not only so ed­i­tors have a place to write com­ments above the text, but be­cause they’re eas­ier to read that way. Con­ven­tion sug­gests a lead­ing value of 50%—that’s 50% larger than (1.5 times the size of) your cho­sen type­face. In other words, if you’re using 12-point type, start with 18 point lead­ing. From there, make fine ad­just­ments to ac­count for the type­face it­self. I like to set a full block of text with my se­lected type­face and type size, then ex­pand the lead­ing so the last line sits per­fectly on the bot­tom of the text box.

Here are sam­ples of 12 point Cen­taur Reg­u­lar set to dif­fer­ent lead­ing spec­i­fi­ca­tions. Type sizes and lead­ing are com­monly spec­i­fied with a slash be­tween them. 12-point type at 18-point lead­ing is no­tated as 12/18.

![Examples of Text Leading](http://theworldsgreatestbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/leading1.gif "Text Leading")

Ex­am­ples of Text Lead­ing

No­tice how the tight lead­ing looks tense, in­tim­i­dat­ing and dif­fi­cult to read? The val­ues in the mid­dle feel com­fort­able. Once we get to 100% lead­ing (12/24), the text starts to fall apart; our eyes have to jump too far from one line to an­other.

When in doubt about mar­gins, lead­ing or other im­por­tant ty­po­graph­i­cal el­e­ments, defer to a trained eye. Even if you’re a do-it-your­self pub­lisher on a bud­get, a ca­pa­ble de­signer likely won’t charge much to help you de­velop some type spec­i­fi­ca­tions for your book. That sim­ple guid­ance can make a huge dif­fer­ence in the book’s final ap­pear­ance.
