#whitesupremacy

https://youtube.com/shorts/NlNi9uUISNc?feature=share

you've studied your history and you did

not take over this country by singing we

shall overcome

you did not gain control of the world

like you have it now by dealing fairly

with a man and keeping your word your

treaty breakers your liars your thieves

you rape entire continents and races of

people then you wonder why these very

people don't have any confidence or

trust in you your religion means nothing

your law is a farce and we see it every

day you demonstrated it in alabama and i

can say you because you're part of the

whole system you profit from it in fact

you make your living from it you

couldn't walk around and talk to people

stand up in your pool pit on sunday and

preach nice little songs and say now

we're going to give thanks to the lord

for he is good and old jesus be among us

as far as we're concerned your jesus is

contaminated just like everything else

you tried to force upon us is

contaminated

so you can have him and here's what i'll

say i wish you would follow jesus like

we followed him

because if you did that then we'd be in

charge tomorrow
