"On the contrary, the problems that a closed loop supply are drivers for innovation"

## **Challenges With Closed-Loop Supply Chains**

While closed-loop supply chains have many substantial advantages, many companies are still hesitant to embrace them. Several obstacles remain that make them difficult to implement. The cost of implementation is perhaps the most significant of these challenges.

Many products are not easily recyclable. The materials and processes manufacturers use can make it difficult to recover much from a used item. As a result, it may require excessive costs to recycle waste, and businesses may not recover enough material to offset these costs.

Establishing an efficient reverse logistics system can also be challenging and incur high costs. Transportation costs will rise to bring old products back to production facilities, and technology expenses will rise as tracking systems expand. While reduced waste may offset these expenses over time, the initial financial burden may be too much for some companies.

Innovation should be managed repeated and improved continously

Problems with Innovation today
Typically not managed
Good to have and not must have
If they have it not managed or tracked
You should set up an Innovation Supply Chain just like your typical production supply chain


Problems with Closed Loop Supply Chains

1) Cost of Implementation of a New Supply Chain this one Closed Loop
2) Products are not easily recycable and recovered materials may not be enough or worth in value to offset the costs.
3) New Transportation, Technology Costs will rise over exisitng technology and transport costs.


Stories
1) More than 75% of Nike Products containt recyled textiles
2) The Farm Powered Strategic Alliance involves companies like Starbucks and Unilever , diverts food waste to businesses that turn in to a renewable energy source 
		 The Farm Powered Strategic Alliance, founded in 2020 by Vanguard Renewables, Unilever, Starbucks, and Dairy Farmers of America, represents a collaborative movement to boost food waste reduction and recycling, and expand renewable energy production across America. The Alliance enables U.S. food manufacturers and retailers to recycle unavoidable food waste on farms where it is combined with farm manure in a Farm Powered anaerobic digester to generate renewable natural gas (RNG). The Alliance is a circular approach that reduces the detrimental environmental impacts of CO2 emissions and offers a pathway to carbon reductions.
