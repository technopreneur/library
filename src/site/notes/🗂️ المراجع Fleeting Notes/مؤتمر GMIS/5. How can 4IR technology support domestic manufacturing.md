One of the explicit goals of Industry 4.0 in the long run is to empower autonomous machine decision making within production processes. This is a lofty goal—requiring highly visible and highly legible data streams combined with AI or [machine learning integration](https://blog.flexis.com/5-uses-for-machine-learning-in-supply-chain-management)—but it does have the potential to add considerable value to supply chain management processes. How does it do so? By freeing up human decision making capacity for larger-scale choices, and by automating the process by which data is turned into action—i.e. creating an implicit set of procedures for different situations that might emerge on the factory floor. In this way, manufacturers can build new efficiencies into their existing processes and drive towards an increasingly optimized supply chain. 

Autonomous machine decision making might seem like a radical change for the industry, but in reality it’s just another form of supply chain decentralization. Decisions that used to be made by a centralized group of executives can now, with IoT (internet of things) integration and other technology, be taken over by decision makers (in this case non-human ones) further down the value stream. Obviously, however, it’s not the only example. Decentralization can also take the form of spreading out decision-making abilities among human planners in disparate plants or locations. This might be less exciting from a technological perspective, but it can be just as value additive.
