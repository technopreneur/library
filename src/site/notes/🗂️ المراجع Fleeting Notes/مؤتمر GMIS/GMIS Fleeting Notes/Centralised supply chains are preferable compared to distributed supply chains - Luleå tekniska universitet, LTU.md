Supply chain configurations with high biomass efficiency show a clear economic advantage, as the advantages of economy-of-scale outweigh the cost of longer transportation. Decentralised supply chain configurations can play a role in particular at very high biofuel production levels or under very high biomass competition. Under lower biomass competition conditions, site specific conditions have a strong influence on the preference for either centralised or decentralised configurations.

## Centralised vs. distributed supply chains

Biorefineries for the production of fuels, chemicals, or materials can be an important contributor to reduce the dependence of fossil fuels. The economic performance of biorefinery supply chains can be improved by different strategies, such as industrial integration in order to e.g. utilise excess heat and products, economy-of-scale benefits from increased plant sizes, and intermediate upgrading to reduce feedstock transport cost. The identification of cost-efficient supply chain configurations is crucial in order to enable large-scale introduction of biorefineries. Two different case studies are outlined to investigate industrially integrated lignocellulosic biorefinery concepts regarding the impact of different economic conditions on the preferred supply chain configurations.

> The centralised supply chain was assessed using chemical (kraft) pulp mills as potential production locations. Distributed supply chain was assessed along two paths: pyrolysis at sawmills, CHP plants and stand-alone forest terminals and; upgrading for gasification at chemical pulp mills.
