As a result of the huge public spending packages 
and extensive monetary expansion carried out  

after the coronavirus economic crisis, the 
vast majority of Western countries landed in  

2022 with some of the highest inflation 
rates recorded in the entire century.
  

We are talking about the fact that, 
in December 2021, for example,  

year-on-year inflation in places like Spain or 
the United States exceeded the 7.5% barrier.
  

And all this, of course, without taking into 
account that from February 2022 the war in Ukraine  

was going to put greater pressure on prices.
 
However, what if I told you that there was one  

country that is getting out of this whole 
inflation crisis? What if I told you that  

there is a place where inflation has been 
completely unknown for more than ten years?
  

Check it out! 

As you can see in this chart, the Swiss 
Confederation seems to play in another  

league as far as inflation is concerned.
 
With price increases up to five times lower  

than their Western neighbors, it is almost 
as if the Swiss live on another planet.
  

Although, yes, I know what 
many of you are thinking:
  

This graph shows that in 2021, 
Switzerland had an inflation rate of 1.6%.  

And, although this is a very low 
rate... Can we really say that there  

is no inflation in Switzerland?
 
Well, let me tell you that,  

in reality, this 1.6% inflation figure is a 
complete exception for the Swiss country:
  

Since 2009, inflation in Switzerland 
has been negative for 70%  

of the years. And that is not all. As you can see, 
when positive inflation levels have been recorded,  

they have never exceeded 1%.
 
Translating this into technical  

language, we could say that Switzerland is 
a country accustomed to deflation. That is,  

prices fall across the board year after year.
 
The question is, why does this phenomenon occur?  

Why on earth is there no inflation in 
Switzerland? Does its central bank,  

unlike the rest of the world, 
not print any money at all?
  

Well, hold on to your chair, because here comes 
the most interesting part... not only is new  

money being printed all the time in Switzerland, 
but also it is being printed at a crazy rate. 

To give you an idea, over 
the last ten years alone,  

the Swiss central bank has increased the volume 
of francs in circulation by a factor of four.
  

This is a huge increase in the 
money supply, as a comparison,  

was almost 60% higher than that of the European 
Central Bank during the same period of time.
  

So, when people tell you that printing 
money inevitably causes inflation,  

you know that the Swiss example shows 
that this is not always the case.
  

In any event, and keeping all this 
in mind, a few questions come up:
  

How on earth does Switzerland manage to avoid 
inflation? What does this country have that  

others don't have besides low taxes and the best 
watches in the world? Is Swiss deflation really a  

better option than the moderate inflation 
levels pursued by the other countries?
  

Today on Visualeconomik, we will 
answer all these questions, stay tuned! 

Have you ever wondered how 
exactly a central bank works?
  

As many of you already know, the 
central bank of a country is the body  

in charge of creating new money, regulating 
interest rates, and controlling inflation, but:
  

What is the step-by-step mechanism 
that allows them to do all this work?  

How does the central bank introduce new money 
into the system in order to control inflation?
  

Well, the answer is first to understand a 
somewhat surprising concept, and that is that  

central banks work almost like companies.
 
They have properties, they have savings,  

they have debts..... And, what’s 
more, they may even have profits.
  

Without going any further, in 2020, the European 
Central Bank made a net profit of more than €1.6  

billion, that’s US$1.68 billion!
 
But wait a minute, because the  

Swiss case goes much further:
 
Not only does the Swiss central bank  

make profits like any other company, but it is 
also listed on the stock exchange. And yes, you,  

yourself, can buy a share and receive part of 
those profits every year! Well, more or less.
  

In any case, we have already gone into all 
the details of this matter in a VisualPolitik  

video that I’ll link for you in the description.
 
But where do these profits come from? What’s more,  

what exactly is the business of a central 
bank that allows it to make money?
  

Well, the truth is that its name makes 
it very clear: the central bank...  

It is first and foremost a bank, and it 
earns money through loans and investments.
  

The question is: To whom does it lend the 
money? And even more importantly, where on  

earth does it get all the money it lends?
 
Well, you see, on the one hand, central  

banks can lend money to governments, and on the 
other, they can lend it to conventional banks.
  

Loans, which like any other bank, are 
granted with interest. Hence the profits.
  

The curious thing about this whole affair is 
that the money lent by the central bank is newly  

created money, newly printed money, so to speak. 
 
So, putting two and two together, the money you  

have in your portfolio came out of a loan that the 
central bank made to a bank or to your government,  

and that sooner or later will have to be 
paid back, for example, through taxes.
  

But... Here’s a question!
 
What does what I have just  

told you have to do with the fact that 
there is no inflation in Switzerland?

Well VisualEconomik viewers, hold 
on because now comes the best part: 

Imagine that in a table like this,  

we write all the accounting movements 
of the European Central Bank: 

In one part, called liabilities, we note the 
total money created in the European economy,  

8.3 trillion Euros, which is US$8.73 trillion.
 
And in the other part, which is called assets, we  

write down to whom all that money has been lent.
 
Specifically, Eurozone governments have been  

lent €4.7 trillion, while commercial 
banks have received €2.2 trillion.
  

However, just a moment, because many of you 
have probably already noticed something:  

if we add up the money from loans granted to 
banks and governments, we are still 1.4 trillion  

euros short of the total amount of money issued.
So the question is, where the hell is that money?
  

Well, you see, what actually happens is that 
central banks have a third way to introduce the  

money they print into the economy. A third way 
about which we haven't told you anything yet:
  

This third way consists of buying 
assets such as stocks, gold,  

or even the currencies of other countries. Assets 
that, let's say, "are kept in a piggy bank".
  

These savings are what is known as the 
central bank's reserves, and .... believe  

me when I tell you that they are essential 
for controlling inflation or exchange rates. 

If a central bank has very high 
reserves, of gold for example,  

when an unexpected period of inflation 
or falling exchange rates occurs,  

it can sell the gold reserves in exchange 
for recovering part of its own currency.
  

By doing so, by repurchasing its currency with 
gold or other assets, the central bank can  

reduce the amount of money in circulation, and 
thus stop the depreciation of its currency. 
  

In other words, having a lot of reserves is 
an important guarantee that a central bank  

will be able to control the supply and demand 
of its currency, or in other words, to ensure  

that its currency has a stable and secure value.
 
But if you want an explanation that is a little  

more concrete, let's go with the numbers:
 
In the case of the European central bank,  

as we have already seen, these reserves total 
about 1.4 trillion euros, that is the eurozone  

has a total backing of its currency of about 17%.
The question is: Can you guess how much  

reserve backing the Swiss central bank has?
 
Well, hold on to your chair because it has no less  

than the figure you see on the screen:
 
91.5%!
  

More than 9 out of 10 Swiss francs are backed 
by gold, by shares of companies such as Amazon,  

Google, Apple, or by assets of foreign countries.
 
And if the reserves of the Swiss central bank were  

divided among the Swiss citizens themselves, 
each of them would receive more than $114,000.
  

Now compare this policy with that of the central 
banks that are dedicated to giving money to the  

government of the day so that they can spend 
it on current spending. Which, by the way,  

is what the ECB and the Fed itself have 
been doing for quite some time now.
  

But let's not get sidetracked.
 
We could say that the Swiss central  

bank is something like a huge investment fund.
 
And take note, because we are not only talking  

about the fact that their reserves are 
extremely high, but also that these reserves  

continue to grow year after year thanks to 
the returns obtained on their investments.

N1(Swiss National Bank increases annual profit 
as stock markets boom. The Swiss National Bank  

expects to make a profit of around 26 billion 
Swiss francs ($28.22 billion) for 2021.
  

Well, thanks to the enormous investments of 
its central bank, Swiss political institutions  

and the Swiss economy have two superpowers 
that are practically unique in the world:
  

The first is that, as a result of the 
central bank's profits, the Swiss State,  

which is the largest shareholder, receives 
extraordinary financing virtually free of charge  

each year.
 
Free money.
  

The second superpower is that, if you think 
about it, a currency with so much backing,  

security and stability is a perfect 
investment for all those savers who  

want to have their money well protected.
 
In other words, during periods of economic  

crisis or inflation, the Swiss franc 
functions practically like gold,  

that is, as a perfect safeguard for the 
savings of a large part of the world.
  

Which, by the way, explains 
news stories like this:
  

N2("The safe-haven Swiss franc gained on 
Friday as fears escalated about the global  

economic impact of the latest coronavirus 
outbreak in China. CNBC, 31 January 2020
  

As you can probably imagine, the fact that the 
Swiss franc has become an investment commodity  

has catapulted its value to intergalactic levels.
 
To give you an idea, while in the year 2000 you  

could buy as little as 60 dollars with 100 Swiss 
francs, today, with the same amount of francs,  

you can buy more than 100 dollars.
 
The value has almost doubled in just 20 years.
  

That said... now think about it for a moment... 
The more investors want to buy francs, the more  

their price will rise, and the more their price 
rises, the easier it will be for the central bank  

to buy new reserves and further guarantee its 
security by attracting more and more investors.

As a result, the central bank can print more 
and more francs to exchange them for foreign  

currencies, which it then converts to a 
large extent into shares. And all this  

without generating inflation.
 
Yes, indeed, the Swiss franc  

is a currency in a constant upward spiral.
 
But wait a minute, we're not done yet! Because  

even though the strength of its central bank is 
more than enough to explain Switzerland's zero  

inflation, there is still a second fundamental 
aspect that we have not yet addressed.
  

Can you guess what it is?
 
1(TRADE PARADISE)
  

I'm sure many of you have heard 
that Switzerland is a tax haven.
  

A country where the rich can take their 
money from [somewhat dubious] sources  

and pay ridiculously low taxes.
 
Well, guess what?..... Sorry to  

disappoint you but after several political 
scandals, the OECD countries managed to  

put Switzerland on the ropes for helping 
money laundering with its banking secrecy.
  

And the question is: Did they really get rid 
of it? Well, they did ((Pointing a finger)).
  

N3("(Era of bank secrecy ends as Swiss start 
sharing account data under international  

pressure. Rich people from around the world can no 
longer use the Alpine republic to hide wealth.)
  

Apparently, at least as far as banking secrecy is 
concerned: no, Switzerland is not a tax haven.
  

Okay, but what about taxes? We all know that 
very little tax is indeed paid in Switzerland,  

but how much tax exactly?
 
Well... Take a look. 

In this graph you can see the percentage 
that, for example, the Swiss and Spanish  

governments take for each euro earned by 
a worker according to his or her income.
  

At first glance, the difference is 
abysmal. We are talking about almost 50%.
  

But, to illustrate it better, let's 
take a more concrete example:
  

While in Spain, a person earning about 30,000 
euros per year has to pay about 5,103 euros  

in taxes, in Switzerland that same person 
would have to pay only about 2,800 euros. 

This, of course, without taking into account 
that the Swiss VAT rate is only 7.7%,  

the social security contributions paid by the 
company, which in Spain are among the highest  

in the world, and the fact that there 
are no taxes such as capital gains tax.
  

And yes, I know what you're thinking, what 
do low taxes have to do with inflation?
  

In short, with Switzerland's low 
taxes, companies from all over the  

world are eager to invest in this country.
 
Not only because they will pay less in taxes,  

but also and above all because these 
same low taxes attract highly skilled  

foreign workers to the country 
that companies can easily hire.
  

While in neighboring France only 
12.38% of its citizens are foreigners,  

in Switzerland this figure almost 
doubles to over 22% of the population.
  

In short, my friends, the demand and value 
of the Swiss franc, together with its low  

inflation, is not only due to the great 
security offered by its central bank,  

but is also motivated by the great conditions 
offered by its economy to new companies.
  

So, knowing all this, I'm certain, for sure, 
that you are now wishing that your country,  

or at least your central bank, would slowly 
start to imitate the Swiss model....
  

Well... hold your horses.... why?... What if I 
told you, in reality, the Swiss government does  

not particularly like this situation very much? 
And what if I were to tell you that the Swiss  

central bank is keen to have higher inflation?
 
Don't believe me? Well... Judge for yourself!
  

N4("Switzerland acts to devalue the franc 
and curb its role as a safe haven currency") 

The Swiss central bank decides to peg 
its currency to an exchange rate of  

1.20 francs to the euro because of the 
risk of overvaluation for the economy")
  

What is certain, VisualEconomik fans, is that 
the deflation that Switzerland has experienced  

over the last few years does not seem to 
be something that makes it feel satisfied.
  

And frankly, there is a good case to be 
made that continued deflation could be  

much worse than moderate inflation.
 
However, that's something we'll look  

at in a future video, as this one 
has already become a bit long.
  

So, at this point, it's your turn: What do you 
think of the Swiss central bank's model? Do you  

think it is the most significant reason for the 
franc's zero inflation? Or maybe you think the  

key lies in the competitiveness of its taxes?
