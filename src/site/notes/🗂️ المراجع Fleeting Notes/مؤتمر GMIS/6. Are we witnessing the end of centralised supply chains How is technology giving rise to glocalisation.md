- Define what a centralized supply chain is
	- On some level, the basic question in [supply chain planning](https://blog.flexis.com/6-supply-chain-management-statistics-to-know) boils down to who should produce (and later transport) what product at what time. In a multi-national corporation with a centralized planning flow, a team of planners in the same geographic location makes that determination for every other touchpoint on the value chain. This can have its advantages: the left hand always knows what the right is doing, and for upper level strategic decisions it can be helpful to have an overarching, company-wide vision for different plants and operators to latch onto. The issues that crop up tend to be a lack of flexibility, because other touchpoints on the supply chain are always waiting for approval from a team that might have to prioritize one thing over another, and sometimes lack direct access to mission critical data (which might be most easily accessible from the various different plants).
- Defined what decentralized supply chain is
	- Unsurprisingly, a decentralized supply chain is basically the opposite. Within the confines of some overarching strategic plan, lower-level decision makers are left to determine what they should produce (or transport) at what time. It’s easy to see the ways in which this could add value: more rapid responses to parts shortages, sudden demand shifts, fleet breakdowns, and other supply chain disruptions that a geographically distant team might not be in a position to respond to optimally; better integration of emerging production data into future plans; more direct contact between empowered decision makers and suppliers/customers, potentially leading to stronger relationships with both; and more active cooperation between teams. At the same time, however, it’s easy to see the ways that such a strategy could [add risk](https://blog.flexis.com/5-primary-causes-of-supply-chain-disruptions). Not only does the probability of operational disconnect (in which disparate teams are working at cross-purposes) increase, you also run the risk of creating data and decision making silos—both of which can produce disruptions down the line.

Glocalisation (the combination of globalisation and localisation) is related to the fact that a company reaches the global market by adapting methods, products, or services which fit specific and local markets’ needs properly. To do this, proximity to and continuous interaction with suppliers and customers are significant. Integration with these parties allows firms to be more effective while reducing operational risks. 2 Thus, redesigning the supply chains based on these pillars by creating end-to-end collaboration, integration, and real-time visibility, makes firms more resilient.
