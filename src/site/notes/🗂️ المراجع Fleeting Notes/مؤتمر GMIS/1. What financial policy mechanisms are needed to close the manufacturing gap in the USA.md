What financial policy mechanisms are needed to close the manufacturing gap in the USA?

- You can't actually close the gap if the cost of manufacturing & shipping is ultimately cheaper 
- and that is by design by China.
- Let me break it down for you China is doing and extremely efficient job in 3 main things
	1)  They are making their global position on the world stage untouchable, with indifference to whatever stance or position you may have regarding any matter it may be, be it geo-political, economical or any matter for sake of argument.
	- Those economies that have supply chains integrated with China risk harming their economies and societies jobs and livelihoods should they decide to disrupt trade based on whatever differences they may have. Resulting in a decision to be made with regards do we stop trading with China and effect our current supply chains and their reprecussionary ripple effects such as decline in production and possible layoffs and furloughs till we sort our alternatives to dealing with China or do we swallow it and continue with disgrunt and eloquent public statements which at the end of the supply mean absolutley nothing.
	3) What they are also doing is devaluing their currency, they started in 2015.

- You will not be able to close that gap, but what you could do is a number of things 
	- the first being you will need to make the cost of manufacturing here in the US less costly and how to do that you will need to primarily lower taxes which add up to the cost
	- the good thing about lowering taxes is that it will stimulate the economy and create more inflation
	- is inflation a good thing well that depends on the context here is that in order for you to allow US made products to be more exportable and affordable for the purpose of increasing demand is that you will need a weaker US dollar vs other Foreign Currencies to make a weaker US dollar you will need to lower taxes thus increasing the purchasing powers of overseas customers there and only there you make US products more affordable and more in demand
	- Furthermore a weaker dollar will make the costs of imports more expensive thus spurring the US manufacturing economy
	- US decision makers should study what China did in 2015 when it devalued the Yuan it did exactly that 
		- It made Chinese products more affordable for Overseas buyers 
		- thus gaining two benefits one they got increased demand for their products thus spuring the economy
		- the second benefits a devalued Yuan made the costs of importing more costly thus pushing the economy to be a localized one

Also fair warning though if the US does start to devalue the dollar against in this case the Chinese that will start a currency war a tit for tat as China would not comprise its global standing

Well the question is what the US should ultimately do? It can introduce legislation that goes against its Free Market mentality where in order to close the manufacturing act legislation regarding the import of Chinese goods should be introduced curtailing the flood gates and als
