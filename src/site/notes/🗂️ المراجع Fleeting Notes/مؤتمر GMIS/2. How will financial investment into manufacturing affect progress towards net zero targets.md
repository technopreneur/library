Here's the dilemma you face when investing in manufacturing if you invest in manufacturing you put the goal post of reaching net-zero say by the 2050 even further exacerbating the problem and at the same time the investment in manufacturing is one of the driving factors of expediting the research and development of 4IR technologies that allow us to be net-zero

The 4IR is driven by AI, ioT and machine learning and the exponential Moore Law Trajectory is fueled by Rapid connesecttive innovation cycle and those cycles are fueled by financial investments into manufacturing 

Story 1: Take for example the case of the Electric Car, it has been sold to you and to everyone that the future is Electric and that it is the right thing to do for the planet and for climate change, and it is morally ethical to do that for the future generations to come. Fine that is a beautiful thing, but you should not just take what is given to without analyzing first and going through the details! Yes you are offsetting the amount of CO2 being released in to the environment by individual cars, but you are actually moving the CO2 from being emitted from the road to the battery manufacturing phase and all the problems and harmful chemicals that some of that waste is slightly radioactive 

- Electricity to charge the car is not environmentaly friendly yet
- the manuafcturing of batteries produces acid waste and radioactive residue that is not handled correctly and poisions and pollutes the environment leading to all sorts of problems in the food chain resulting in a variety of diseases and issues and numerous death possibly
- also the process of manufacturing of the battery itself has the highest environmental impact when it comes to electrcity production.
