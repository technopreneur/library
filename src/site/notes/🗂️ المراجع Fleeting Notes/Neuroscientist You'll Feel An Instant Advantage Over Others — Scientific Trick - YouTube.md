the person that's not motivated that

can't get off the couch that doesn't

want to do anything well this is the

problem look I'm not judging I do this

stuff too right if you've ever scrolled

social media and you're like I don't

even know why I'm doing this it doesn't

really feel that good when you think

about dollar euro Bitcoin ethereum you

think about wins and losses in sport and

life and relationship and anything

something in your brain and body has to

keep track of that did you win did you

lose what's a letdown one of the most

important findings in the last few years

in Neuroscience is that the molecule

dopamine is associated with reward it's

more about motivation and craving that's

really the key when I say the common

currency is dopamine what I mean is the

molecule dopamine when secreted in the

brain makes us pursue things build

things create things makes us want new

things that we don't currently already

have it's more accurate really to think

about dopamine as driving motivation and

craving to go Secret Awards and it's a

way of tabulating where we are in our

life are we doing well or are we doing

poorly and that happens on very short

time scales might you wake up feeling

good or do you wake up feeling kind of

low or on long time scales if you're

halfway through a long degree or you're

halfway through your life how are you

doing how do you gauge that well it has

everything to do with how much dopamine

you were releasing in the previous days

and weeks and years so you're always

comparing it and all of this is

subconscious but what's cool is that

once you make these processes conscious

once you understand a little bit about

how dopamine is released and how it

changes our perspective and our Behavior

then you can actually work with it and

this is really the New Evolution of the

understanding of dopamine and

Neuroscience which is that dopamine

itself is not the reward it's the build

up to the reward so the the keys are to

pursue rewards but understand that the

pursuit is actually the reward if you

want to have repeated wins okay you the

celebration has to be less than the

pursuit and that's hard for some people

to do if you can start to identify the

craving as its own internally released

drug this thing dopamine that is a

source of motivation then what you

realize is that capturing the reward is

wonderful but attaching dopamine to the

reward is actually a little bit

dangerous celebrating the win more than

the pursuit it actually sets you up for

failure in the future and so this gets

us right into something called dopamine

reward prediction error and reward

prediction error is basically if you

expect something to be really great and

then it's not quite that great your

dopamine Baseline lowers and now

understanding what we know about

dopamine that means that not only did

you you feel as if you lost because it

wasn't as much a celebration as you

thought it would be but it also means

that you're starting from a lower Place

meaning you are less motivated anytime

you have a bunch of dopamine and you're

in Pursuit Pursuit Pursuit after you

achieve a win now this could be a

business win a relationship a win of any

kind but inevitably there's going to be

be a tipping back of the scale on the

pain side and that pain side is always

going to go a little bit higher than the

dopamine side so this is what you would

feel if you pursued a goal like building

a big company here it comes here comes

the big sale and then there's the well

what now the kind of let down now if you

wait if you simply wait and stop

pursuing dopamine for a short while the

scale starts to reset the problem is a

lot of people immediately roll right

into the next Pursuit and then what

happens is that scale starts to get

stuck on the pain side a little bit more

a little bit more a little bit more and

pretty soon no amount of seeking will

allow you to experience that craving and

motivation so what what does this mean

in terms of an actual tool well first of

all if people can do what you do they're

going to be in a much better position in

life doesn't matter if it's School sport

relationship any domain of life if you

can start to register ah that craving

and that friction and that desire that

almost kind of low level of agitation

sometimes high level of agitation that

is that I'm trying to pose my will on

the world in a benevolent way we hope

that's dopamine it's working with its

close cousin which is epinephrine which

is adrenaline they are very close

because in fact dopamine manufactures

epinephrine a lot of people don't know

this but adrenaline is actually made

from the molecule dopamines okay so

those two are hanging out together it's

like crave work crave work craving work

craving work Craven work and then you

get the win and some people allow the

big peak in dopamine to be associated

with the wind and smart people learn to

adjust their celebration internally

right this is all internal you could

throw the biggest party in the world but

as long as you're kind of laid back and

looking at this not letting yourself get

manic crazy you won't necessarily crash

as hard and pretty soon your system will

reset so you take the day you clean up

the dishes you relax you go what now I'm

feeling a little low well rather than

going out and spiking your dopamine

again just wait understand that the

scale will reset again give yourself a

few days where you're going to feel a

little kind of underwhelmed things

aren't going to be as interesting it's

going to be hard to trigger that big

release because you just had the peak

well if you adjust that you relax you

understand there's always a little bit

of a postpartum depression we sometimes

hear about postpartum depression that's

a clinical thing but there's always that

kind of today's not as exciting as the

previous days what what am I going to do

with my life but then if you let it

start ratcheting up again then what you

realize is your capacity to tap into

dopamine as a motivator not just seeking

dopamine rewards that is infinite and I

I can say with with great certainty that

this is

how you were able to build a big company

and sell it have you been able to build

a successful podcast and sell it how

you're constantly seeking because

seeking is the reward and I think for

most people we think of the reward as

the finish line and so the key is to get

to the Finish Line step into the end

zone but no end zone dance that's the

key to doing it over and over and when I

see big athletes or academics or anyone

or musicians and they rise and crash

it's clear they've lost the touch with

the motivation evoked dopamine
