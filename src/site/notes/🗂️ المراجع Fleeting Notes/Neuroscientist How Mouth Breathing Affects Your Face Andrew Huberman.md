#neuroscience

you'll see these people their mouth

breathers

can it also change face shape yeah so

this is a wild book called Jaws a hidden

epidemic by colleagues of mine at

Stanford there's one case of this young

girl who just she got a pet hamster I

think it was got a allergy to the

hamster and literally took this

beautiful young girl and she just her

face just starts aging at a rapid rate

they get rid of the hamster she goes

back to nasal breathing they do a little

encouragement of nasal breathing using

the mouth closure thing at night do a

little bit of medical tape and like

these beautiful almost like model-esque

features come back in this girl jaw

shape and the clearer to the nasal

passages and this was known in the 1800s

there was a book called shut your mouth

by a British Doctor Who talked about the

fact that people who snore

sleep like this and then during the

daytime they become mouth breathers he

said they become less attractive than

the people who are nose breathers it's

really interesting and this is like a

zero cost thing but um it's not

emphasized enough at all
