#thinking #jordanpeterson 

a degraded view of humanity uh i feel

where we are effectively like

marionettes um and that we we're just

being played and that we don't have any

agency anymore and therefore uh we can't

be responsible for our own words not not

just our actions we can't be responsible

for our own words and their and the

ramifications so we have to be

controlled and we have to be stifled by

the state and it's very it makes me very

nervous

so i've been thinking through

um the importance of free speech i

suppose from a psychological perspective

and

it seems to me that

well we can walk through some axioms and

you can tell me what you think about

them if you would

so

i mean the first thing we might posit is

that

it's useful to think it's better to

think than not to think and that might

seem self-evident but

but thought can be troublesome and stir

up trouble and your thoughts can be

inaccurate so

it's perhaps not that

unreasonable to

start the questioning there but

i think it was alfred north whitehead

who said that

thinking allows

our thoughts to die

instead of us

and so

he was thinking about the evolution of

thought in some sense from a biological

perspective so imagine a creature that's

incapable of thought

has to act something out

a representation of the world or an

intent it has to be embodied

and then if that fails

well it fails in action and so the

consequence of that might be death it

might be very severe

whereas

once you can think

you can represent the world abstractly

you can divorce the abstraction from the

world and then you can produce

avatars of yourself

sometimes in image like in dreams let's

say or in literature and fiction and

movies and so on produce avatars of

ourselves that are fictional

and then run

them as simulations in the abstract

world and observe the consequences

and

we do that in our stories we do that

when we dream we do that when we imagine

in images and depict a dramatic scenario

playing itself out but then we also do

that in words because

we encode those images it's one more

level of abstraction we encode those

images into words and those words become

partial dramatic avatars and then the

words can battle with one another so

thought seems to work let's say verbal

thought

you ask yourself a question

you receive an answer in some mysterious

manner there's an internal revelation of

sorts that's the spontaneous thought you

know when you sit down to write a book

thoughts come to you perhaps because you

pose yourself a question and no one

knows how that works but we experience

it that thoughts manifest themselves in

the theater of our imagination

so that's the revelatory aspect and then

there's the critical aspect which is

well now you've thought this and perhaps

you've written it down

can you generate counter positions

are there universes that you can imagine

where this doesn't apply are there

situations where it doesn't apply are

there better ways of formulating that

thought and but i would say

with regard to critical thought and to

some degree with regard to productive

thought

an

indeterminate

proportion of that is dependent on

speech

i i don't think it's unreasonable to

point out that thought is internalized

speech

and that the dialectical process that

constitutes critical thinking is

internalized speech so you and i are

engaging in a dialectic enterprise

you'll pause it something and i'll

respond to it and you'll respond to that

and

we're we're

we're in a kind of combat there's some

cooperation about it as well

and we're attempting to formulate a

truth more clearly at least in principle

if we're being honest

we do that when we're speaking so our

thought the quality of our thought is

actually dependent on our ability to

speak our minds absolutely and then

sure go ahead well i i couldn't agree

more because i think

speech is the way in which we

collaborate on our thoughts you know

that that's how it how it works you you

refine those thought processes that

you've described i mean i'm no i'm no

psychologist but i understand this basic

premise that that

we have these various thoughts that are

continually in conflict within ourselves

unless we're able to articulate them and

to engage in others through that process

through that transactional process of

speech

then those thoughts are never refined

and they remain in this kind of infancy

and this is yes

they're as refined as we can make them

as individuals but that's also assuming

that you even have the words which you

also learned in a dialectical process

right exactly it's not as though the

truth is ever uh fully graspable but we

can we can get nearer to it through that

collaborative process of speaking and

articulating the thoughts and in fact

even in the act of like you say writing

or articulating yourself uh

as with your self-authoring program for

instance the act of writing things out

is what clarifies the points of view for

you i've actually found that the the the

the way that i think about these issues

now is largely a product of of the fact

that i've written so much about it and

changed my mind through the act of

learning how to express myself on these

points and and and the and the

consequence of not having that

opportunity

i think is uh

something i would barely want to

contemplate and i think that to give an

example of of uh

of the moment which is that because any

kind of attempt to have a discussion or

debate about the perceived conflict

between trans rights and gender critical

feminism because to even attempt that

discussion at the moment will have such

uh grave social consequences and

certainly in terms of career prospects

major consequences people will not have

that discussion i have people i know in

politics in the media and they say to me

quite honestly i will not talk about

this i have concerns i have qualms i

want answers to questions but i

absolutely will not open my mouth about

this and if you don't do that uh this is

why no one understands the issue this is

why no one has reached any kind of

consensus on this issue all we have is a

sense in which to have the quote unquote

wrong opinion makes you a pariah

and therefore i'd better not have that

opinion well then that's not a sincerely

held conviction that's just that's just

if the definition of wrong is

continually transforming and in an

unpredictable manner then it's best just

to sidestep the issue entirely and then

that leaves it murky and ill-defined and

assuming that you believe that thought

has any utility and so when you're

sitting down to write when i'm sitting

down to write

and i produce a sentence you know it

might have come from some theoretical

perspective maybe i'm approaching

something from a freudian perspective or

a marxist perspective or a uh or a an

enlightenment perspective etc i mean

it's it's a

it's a it's a psychological trope i

suppose that

we all think the thoughts of dead

philosophers right we think we have our

own opinions but that's really very very

very very rarely the case it's not that

easy to come up with something truly

original and generally make incremental

progress at best and so your ability to

abstractly represent the world and then

to generate

avatars that can be defeated without you

dying is dependent on your incorporation

of a multitude of opinions and that in

itself is a consequence of

i mean that works to the degree that

communication is actually free and that

you can get access to as much thought as

you can possibly manage so i can't see

how you can deny the centrality

of free speech as a fundamental right or

the fundamental right perhaps

unless you simultaneously deny the

utility of thought but maybe if you are

also inclined to

remove the individual

from the central position of the

political discourse then maybe you can

also

make the case at least implicitly that

individual thought doesn't matter and

that mostly it's just causing trouble

but i think individual thought is key

and actually even in the the the outline

you've described there there isn't there

is individual agency in reaching a

conclusion that has been articulated

before insofar as if you are engaged

with a multitude of writers and

philosophers and artists and ideas and

you've come out with a perspective well

that perspective may not be original to

you but the process that you've gone

through to reach that viewpoint is

individual to you you know there is a

power in that's there's something

important about that you know there's

something crucial it's if you're a

practicing psychotherapist

one of the things you have to learn

is to not provide people with your words

too much

what you want is for them to formulate

the

conclusion

and you can guide them through the

process of investigation you talked

about the self-authoring process and

which is online at selfauthoring.com

that

it steps people say through the process

of writing an autobiography of analyzing

their current virtues and faults and of

making a future plan the utility of all

of that is dependent on

the the person who's

um undertaking the exercise

generating their own

verbal representations right

and that seems to cement it somehow as

yours if you've come up with the words

and so it's that it's the uppermost

expression of personhood the ability to

have the words that you should speak

reveal themselves to you and to have the

right to express them as you see fit

yes in which case if you if you are

merely repeating an accepted script then

then to what extent can you say to can

you even say to be an individual at all

you know

this this to me well i think that's part

of the philosophical conundrum is that

if you believe that all people do is

repeat pre-digested scripts especially

if

your view is that the fundamental human

motivation is power and the entire

social landscape is nothing but a

competition between

equally

what would you say selfish and

single-minded

powers drivers

then there is no

individual

there's no individual in that conceptual

world

and it seems to me that that's the world

that

we're being pushed to

inhabit and are criticized for on moral

grounds for criticizing
