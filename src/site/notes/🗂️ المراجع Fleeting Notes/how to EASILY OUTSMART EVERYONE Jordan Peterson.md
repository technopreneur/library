the best thing you can do is teach

people to write because there's no

difference between that and thinking and

one of the things that just blows me

away about universities is that no one

ever tells students why they should

write something it's like well you have

to do this assignment well why are you

writing well you need the grade it's

like no

you need to learn to think

because thinking makes you act

effectively in the world thinking makes

you win the battles you Undertake and

those could be battles for good things

if you can think and speak and write you

are absolutely deadly nothing can get in

your way

so that's why you learn to write

and I can't believe that people aren't

just told that it's it's it's like

it's the most powerful weapon you can

possibly provide someone with and I mean

I know lots of people who've been

staggeringly successful and watched them

throughout my life I mean those people

you don't want to have an argument with

them they'll just slash you into pieces

if you're gonna make your point and

they're gonna make their point you

better have your points organized

because otherwise you are going to look

like and be an absolute idiot you are

not going to get anywhere and if you can

formulate your arguments coherently and

make a presentation if you can speak to

people if you can lay out a proposal God

people give you money they give you

opportunities you have influence that's

the most dangerous thing you can

possibly be

so and that's motivating if people know

that it's like well why are you learning

to write because you're here's your

sword here's your M16 right here's your

bulletproof vest like you learn how to

use them it's an endless mystery to me

why

that isn't made self-evident it's like

people are there's a there's a

conspiracy to bring people into the

education system to make them weaker

so

I guess that keeps the competition down

maybe that's one way of thinking about

it

if your students are stupid they're not

going to challenge you
