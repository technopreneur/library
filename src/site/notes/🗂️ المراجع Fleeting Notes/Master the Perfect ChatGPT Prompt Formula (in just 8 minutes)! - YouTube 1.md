**Master the Perfect ChatGPT Prompt Formula (in just 8 minutes)! - YouTube**
- Introduction by Jeff, a tech professional, emphasizing the importance of effective prompting for ChatGPT and Google Bard.
- Six key building blocks for a good prompt: 
  1. **Task** - Start the task sentence with an action verb and clearly state the end goal.
  2. **Context** - Provide relevant background information by answering:
     - What's the user's background?
     - What does success look like?
     - What environment are they in?
  3. **Exemplars** - Include examples within the prompt to improve the output quality.
     - Rewriting resume bullet points.
     - Interview prep with the STAR framework.
     - Referring to existing job descriptions.
  4. **Persona** - Define who you want ChatGPT to represent (e.g., physical therapist, recruiter).
     - Can also use famous personalities or fictional characters.
  5. **Format** - Visualize the desired format of the end result.
     - Examples: Tables, bullet points, paragraphs, markdown.
     - When proofreading, specify changes to be bolded.
  6. **Tone** - Define the tone or feeling you're going for, whether casual, formal, witty, etc.
     - Use adjectives/adverbs to describe the desired tone.
- Comprehensive prompt example: 
  - Writing an email as a senior product marketing manager at Apple announcing the success of the Apple car.
- Highlighted the difference between a comprehensive and simple prompt.

I don't usually overhype myself but in this video we're going over the only formula you will ever need to master prompting on ChatGPT and Google Bard so let's get started hey friends welcome back to channel if you're new here my name is Jeff I work full-time in Tech and if you're anything like me a couple months ago you know prompting is an important skill to learn but you're not exactly sure why some prompts generate outputs that are super generic While others give you precisely what you're

looking for since then I've spent hundreds of hours taking prompt engineering courses and applying what I've learned in my daily life and so in this video I'm sharing the six building blocks that make up a good prompt so that you can use this formula to consistently generate high quality outputs first it's critical to not only know what the six components are task context exemplars Persona format and tone but also know that there's an order of importance to these six components to show you what I mean let's use this

simple example I'm a 70kg male give me a three-month training program the first part is context followed by the task the reason why the task is higher up in the form of the hierarchy is if we just input the task without the context there's still some sort of meaningful output but if we just give ChatGPT the context nothing really happens put another way it's mandatory to have a task in your prompt it's important to include relevant context and exemplars and it's nice to have Persona format and

tone when you think of writing your prompt go down this mental checklist so this formula will act as a constant reminder for you to include just enough relevant information when writing prompts and as you'll see in this next part you do not need all six components in every prompt to have a good output now let's break down each building block with specific examples starting with the task the rule of thumb is to always start the task sentence with an action verb generate give write analyze Etc and clearly articulate what your end goal is

it could be one simple task like generating a three-month training program or a complex three-step ask like analyzing hundreds of user feedback sharing the top three takeaways and categorizing the feedback based on the team responsible for following up the second component context is the trickiest to get right because technically there's an infinite amount of information you can give so I found asking myself these three questions to be super helpful in coming up with just enough information to get a good result

from ChatGPT first what's the user's background second what does success look like and third what environment are they in Back to the workout example we now have I'm a 70kg male looking to put on five kilograms of muscle mass over the next three months I only have time to go to the gym twice a week and for one hour each session give me a three-month training program to follow could I have added more background information of course only prioritize the muscle groups that make me look good on Instagram

but the key to staying productive with ChatGPT and Bard is giving just enough information to constrain the endless possibilities by the way although this video is not sponsored it is supported by those of you who subscribe to my paid productivity newsletter on Google workspace tips Link in the description to learn more moving over to the exemplars component it's just a fancy way of saying examples basically all the research on large language models LLMs have shown that including examples within the prompt drastically improves

the quality of the output starting with a simple example this is a poorly written bullet point from a resume we can now ask ChatGPT to rewrite this bullet point using this structure I accomplished X by the measure y that resulted in Z which is actually best practice by the way so actually do this in your resume for example I lowered Hospital mortality rate by 10% by educating nurses in new protocols which translates to 200 lives saved per year here's a slightly more complicated example for interview prep

based on my own resume write me an answer to the interview question what's your biggest weakness use the star answer framework situation task action and results here instead of using a full-blown interview answer as an example which would be overkill the star framework acts as an example structure for ChatGPT to follow last example let's say you need to write a job description you give some context around the opening and ask ChatGPT to reference an existing job description if I use this one I found on LinkedIn the

output will follow the same formatting and use the same professional HR-y language saving me a bunch of time main takeaway here exemplars are not necessary for every prompt but including a relevant example or framework will greatly improve the quality of your output moving along the Persona component is basically who you want ChatGPT and Bard to be and the pro tip here is to think of someone you wish you had instant access to with the task you're facing if you enjoyed yourself working out that person might be a

physical therapist with experience helping athletes recover if you're a job Seeker that person might be a recruiter or hiring manager if you're working on a creative brief that person might be a senior product marketing manager who's great at storytelling Pro tip you can also name specific individuals but I found the results to be good only when they're famous enough like Warren Buffett Steve Jobs Jeff Su by the way I just have to share this we have a team off-site with a superheroes theme so I asked ChatGPT to draft an

email from Batman and it even included things like please let Alfred know and signed off as Your Dark Knight um so fictional characters work as well and I'm actually going to use this the fifth component format the pro tip here is to literally close your eyes and visualize how exactly you want the end result to look like a million likes on my thirst bomb Instagram photo damn it didn't work back to the user feedback example I don't want to read each sentence so I asked ChatGPT to take all the feedback and output a table with

three headers the original feedback the team responsible for following up and priority and now I can copy this directly and paste it into a Google sheet sort by priority and filter by team other common formats include emails bullet points and code blocks but the one I found to be the most useful as a full-time working professional is paragraphs and markdown for example I just received a lengthy industry report for my director first give me the three key takeaways then summarize based on topic use H2 as section headers here is

the report Pro tip whenever I use ChatGPT to proofread any document I specify that all changes need to be bolded so I can easily see exactly what has been changed let's quickly go through the last component tone before we put all this together in one example the good news is tone is easy to understand use a casual or formal tone of voice give me a witty output show enthusiasm sound pessimistic the bad news is we're usually not very good at recalling the thousands of potential adjectives and adverbs at a moment's notice so here's a

pro tip tell ChatGPT the feeling you're going for for example I'm writing an email to a team I haven't worked with before and I want to be taken seriously without coming off as too stuck up and cringy can you please give me a list of five tone keywords I can include in a prompt for ChatGPT and look now in the actual prompt I can say use clear and concise language and write in a friendly get confident tone putting all this together let's look at this comprehensive prompt you are a senior product marketing manager at Apple

Persona and you have just unveiled the latest Apple product in collaboration with Tesla the Apple car and received 12 000 pre-orders which is 200% higher than Target context write an email to your boss Tim Cookie sharing this positive news task and format the email should include at tl;dr too long didn't read section project background why this product came into existence business results section quantifiable business metrics and end with a section thanking the product and Engineering teams example structure use clear and concise

language and write in a confident yet friendly tone tone note that if I had an existing email to reference I could delete the instructions around the structure and simply tell ChatGPT the email should follow the exact same format as a one I'll share below and paste the email from before by the way you can compare the output from this prompt to that of a simpler prompt I just launched a new product at the Apple car I received 12 000 pre-orders please write an email to my boss with this update there's a pretty

big difference in terms of how generic and usable the end result is now that you know the basics of prompting my next video is going to take you from beginner to Pro so make sure you're subscribed for that check out my top five ChatGPT productivity tips for work see you on the next video in the meantime have a great one
