I completed a Ph.D. in three years. I did not want to but I had a family and needed to get back to earning a living. Here is how I did it.

1.  Proposed a Master’s thesis in the first quarter of grad school. Completed it by the following June. Also obtained a small grant ($5k) for a study that was later published and nationally recognized as an important study.
2.  Obtained a $50k research grant that funded my Ph.D. research and three other grad students before defending the Master’s thesis. We collected data and administered diagnostic tests to over 1,000 consecutive admissions to the Department of Corr

Have your dissertation almost written when you join the program. A friend of mine from Graduate school had a project he started as an undergraduate, completed it in a little over a year, defended his remarkable dissertation and then he spent the rest of the second year taking the qualifying exams so he can graduate. He was out in two years.

Doing Ph.D. With Just 10% Efforts. Myth or Reality?

1\. Ph.D. Is Huge Task?

There is a general misconception that PhD is very tough exam to crack & not everyone can do that, but that is just a myth. People misunderstand the PhD course. One of the most misleading myths about PhD study is that it requires exceptional intelligence and that only a small number of remarkable people can achieve a doctorate.

This isn’t true.

A PhD isn’t an intelligence test. It’s a research project. A doctorate won’t turn you into a genius (or confirm that you already are one). It will make you an expert in a very specifi

This depends on whether you mean "any PhD" and whether you don't care about the quality of the PhD. I'll answer it for two cases: (a) Getting any PhD really quickly and (b) becoming a productive PhD student.

a) Let's begin by assuming you just want "any" PhD really quickly (say, you marry in a year and want to be called "Dr" during the ceremony or whatever). There are essentially a few things you can do:  
1) Pick a country where your advisor and examiner are identical (say, Germany) and where preferably advisors have some benefit from graduating research students (research money, important for t

PhD is that unique degree, where the exam does not have a definite syllabus. Let’s understand this details: when you are a student in school, college or university for an undergraduate, postgraduate degree, your instructor follows a definite syllabus and the exams are conducted on that only (except in few cases, like open book exam or term papers, but still syllabus is limited!). In your PhD, neither you will get an instructor to teach you topic wise and check your learning, nor having a definite syllabus. Rather here, if you are working in a rapidly developing area, you have to keep up with t

Work as as fast as you possibly can.

A more sensible answer extends as follows:

-   Work with experienced supervisors who are strong in your sub-field
-   Do not engage in paid employment
-   Do not proctastinate
-   Choose a topic that is straight forward, especially data collection. A content analysis of a small sample of Internet material is usually quicker than a project that uses a longitudinal study or an embedded ethnography.

Be bad enough such that your professor wants to fire you, but be good enough such that firing you is hard.

That might sound strange, but that’s how it is. This is rare, but I have heard such stories several times.

If you are looking for a research job, how long your PhD takes will not matter. What will matter is what you have accomplished. So you shouldn’t rush to finish your PhD. Instead, aim to finish at a normal duration (whatever is normal in your department).

However, sometimes, there are PhD students who are bad enough such that the professor is desperate to kick him out, but at the same ti
