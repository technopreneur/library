here's a primary religious injunction

treat the other person like you would

like to be treated yourself

that does not mean

be nice to other people it does not mean

sacrifice yourself excessively for other

people

it means

think about the other person as if they

were you

and figure out how you can mutually

interact to better both of you at the

same time you have to build yourself

into the equation it's an equation

it's not that it's not that others are

more valuable it's that we're all

valuable we're equally valuable and then

you think well how do you remind

yourself of that and the answer to that

is through terror

because terror is the genuine motivator

so they say

fear of god is the beginning of all

wisdom well what does that mean

it means first that you don't get away

with anything

that's really useful to know that

because if you really know that

you won't try to get away with well you

still will because people are stupid but

but at least it will mitigate the

possibility so

here i'll tell you something that jung

said this is quite this is quite

profound and and it's i think the right

answer to this question so jung believed

he was interested in

the emergence of higher morality uh

something that the developmental

psychologist jean piaget was also

interested in psja thought we started

out as individuals then we learned to

play games with other people kids

children learned how to play games with

other children and that made them social

so our society is a game it's a giant

game that we're all

playing together voluntarily and so

children first learned how to play the

game and only later did they learn the

rules of the game they learned how to

play the game first and then learned the

rules how to speak the rules and then at

some point they realized that they were

also creators of the rules

and so that's

moral development

on a continual on on a it's not a

continuum it's it's it's a fractured

staircase upward but jung was interested

in

elements of moral

action that were higher than that and so

he conceptualized it symbolically so

imagine this

he did this in the last book he wrote

called mysterium conjunctions

so imagine that

you you exist so that your conceptual

structures and your emotions are in

uneasy relationship with one another so

you're sort of a house divided amongst

yourself

and so what you have to do is you have

to put together your mind and your and

your emotions so that they're working as

a as a unit and you do that in part by

actually being forthright about what it

is that you want

for yourself and and to other people and

to learn how to negotiate that so that

inner tension disappears and so now

you're a unified

you're a unified entity of emotion and

thought they're not

conflicting with one another and then

what you do is you take that

entity which is still in some sense

separate from your body because you're

not acting these out and you bring those

two together and he thought about that

as

the psychological equivalent of the

incarnation it's it's integrated spirit

integrating with the body and what that

means is that you take your emotions and

motivations and capacity for thinking

that are now one thing and you act out

those things you so you embody them in

the world and that's another thing that

brings integrity and then there was a

step past that and the step past that is

to understand that there's no d so you

have the integrated spirit mind and body

[Music]

in opposition to the world and this the

next thing you do is realize that there

is no opposition with the world

you're walking down the street blue

street is a good example of this in

toronto and they're decimated alcoholic

schizophrenics littering the landscape

so to speak you walk around them you say

well that's not me it's like yes it is

it's you in so far as your tendency is

to react in a in a negative way and to

skirt the territory it's it's a

disturbance in your field of being it's

you

now you don't know what to do about it

and i wouldn't recommend that you do

anything because you'd probably just

make it worse it's a very big problem

that's lying there on the sidewalk and

it may be well beyond your capacity to

fix it but insofar as it's a disturbance

in your field of being it's you

it's you and all the problems that are

in the world that that you experience

they're you and so you stop thinking

about things in terms of an opposition

between what's good for you and what's

good for the world because there's no

difference there's no difference between

the two and that doesn't mean that the

pathway

from what's good

for you in your more limited domain to

what's good for everyone is an easy one

to compute it's very very difficult but

there is no there is no technical

difference between them

you know so if i'm engaged in a

psychotherapeutic dialogue with my

clients when i'm doing it properly

it's not like they're learning from me

it's that we're learning together and

every time i solve one of their problems

or help them solve one of their problems

i help myself solve one of my problems

you know because people bring to me

bring into my sessions the terrible

things that go wrong with people in life

their partner has cancer their father

has a father has alzheimer's they're

suffering with alcoholism their career

is collapsing like these aren't things

that are happening to them

these are things that happen to everyone

and to figure out how to solve that for

someone is to figure out how to solve it

for yourself there's no difference

whatsoever

so then the the terror thing emerges

when you start to realize that those

problems that you don't address that are

maybe magnified by your impulsive and

foolishly self-centered and instrumental

behavior you're manipulating the world

on behalf of your own narrow interests

those will come back to haunt you

and so you it's a terrifying thing to

think through

but once you think it through and

understand it then what happens is

you're more afraid of acting selfishly

than you are willing to do it you think

no i'm not doing that why because i know

all hell will break loose if i do that

and i'm not going there

and so the terror element is a huge one

it makes it it it fortifies your

because you can't just act

properly you don't have the moral

fortitude for that you can aim at the

good and run from what's terrible then

you're then you're motivated

if you look at if you look at the most

archaic of archetypal heroes

those heroes confront something that

represents chaos it's usually a monster

that bears a treasure of some sort and

that's a symbolic representation of the

class of all unexplored things right

because things that we have not yet

explored are threatening and destructive

but also

offer us infinite potential

but more elaborated hero stories let's

say also reverse that and say that well

there are times when the order has

become so corrupt and rigid that free

speech fragments it into its part so

that it can rejuvenate itself

and so i mean actually in the gospels

that's the hero that christ is basically

represented as he's not so much the

dragon confronting the dragon slayer who

gathers the treasure although that's

implicit in the in the juxtaposition of

christ with the figure of like a

serpentile satan but christ is the thing

that stands up against the corrupt state

and rejuvenates it through speech and so

technically speaking

free speech the logos is the thing that

mediates between chaos and order and you

can think about this is represented in

in in many cultures this idea you can

see it most specifically i would say in

the taoist conceptualization because in

the taoist world being is made out of

[[üóÇÔ∏è ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿπŸÑŸäŸÇÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÖÿ±Ÿäÿ© Literature Notes/ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÑÿ≥ŸÅÿ© Philosophy/Chaos and Order\|Chaos and Order]] yin and yang masculine

and feminine fundamentally it's chaos

and order and order is the fact that

wherever you go there are things you

understand and or and chaos is the fact

that wherever you go there are things

you don't understand and so the idea is

that being is made out of the things

that you understand and the things that

you don't understand and it's always

that way which is why dao is the symbol

of being per se and it's the case your

brain is adapted in fact it's partly why

it has two hemispheres for the world

that you understand and the world you

don't understand the world you

understand roughly speaking being

handled by the left in the world you

don't understand roughly speaking being

handled by the right

well it's that line down the middle

that's dow

that's meaning and if you have one foot

in chaos and one foot in order you're

maximizing information flow and

rejuvenating yourself at the same time

that you're maintaining your structure

and you will report on that internally

as engagement in the world

it's the most fundamental orienting

sense that you have and it's deeply

instantiated neurologically unbelievably

deeply and so it really is the case from

an evolutionary perspective that reality

is chaos in order it's that to which

you're adapted

[Music]

because what you do in psychotherapy as

well

in addition to helping people face the

things that they're most afraid of so

that they can overcome them

is to allow them to tell someone the

truth

what happened to you all listen

so they tell you and they take

themselves apart and put themselves

together while they're speaking the

truth about what happened

and it puts them together it's at the

you know the two fundamental elements of

psychotherapy are

let's find what you're afraid of and

avoiding and help you confront it so

that you can gather the information

that's there

and let's allow you to lay your story

out in all of its catastrophe and detail

so that you can straighten yourself out

through speech it's exactly what happens

in psychotherapy so it should happen in

every real relationship it's it's the

spiritual purpose of a marriage

fundamentally right because you face

someone who's different than you that

you're tied to and cannot run from and

so you can reveal yourself really really

it's a critical it's a critical part of

marriage because if you can run

from someone they will never show you

their true face

because if someone shows you their true

face you will run

[Music]

and so you say in a marriage ceremony

i will allow you to show me your true

face and i will not run

and unless you mean that you'll never be

married you'll never understand what it

means and you'll never reap the benefits

of it which are practical obviously but

also spiritual and psychological there's

a reason for the vow but it has to be a

vow because otherwise you have a back

door open and you'll never really tell

the person what you're like and no

bloody wonder because really who wants

to know what you're like

not even you that's for sure

[Music]

you
