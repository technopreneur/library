this is a wild literature and I love it

and it's changing the way that I do

things I thought that to remember things

you're supposed to get really really

excited really focused

and remember them and guess what that's

not how you do it there are data and

there are stories going back to Medieval

Times that they used to teach kids

things and then throw them in the river

there's a beautiful annual review of

Neuroscience and it turns out that if

you want to remember something you want

to spike adrenaline after you acquired

that information after

that means the Double Espresso and the

ice bath after you study for math

immediately after and you think about

this you know that makes perfect sense

right think about the one trial learning

that nobody wants to experience which is

a car accident or some traumatic thing

you didn't get the spike of adrenaline

first you got the spike of adrenaline

after and it's also true that if you

tell yourself that something's really

important to you you'll you'll be able

to learn it better
