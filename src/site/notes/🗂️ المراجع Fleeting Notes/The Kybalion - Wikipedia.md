The Kybalion

***The Kybalion*** (full title: ***The Kybalion: A Study of the Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece***) is a book originally published in 1908 by "Three Initiates" (often identified as the [New Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Thought "New Thought") pioneer [William Walker Atkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Walker_Atkinson "William Walker Atkinson"), 1862–1932)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-1) that purports to convey the teachings of [Hermes Trismegistus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus "Hermes Trismegistus").

While it shares with ancient and medieval [Hermetic texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetica "Hermetica") a number of traits such as [philosophical mentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalism_(philosophy) "Mentalism (philosophy)"), the concept of '[as above, so below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_above,_so_below "As above, so below")', and the idea that everything consists of gendered polar opposites, as a whole it is more indebted to the ideas of modern [occultist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultist "Occultist") authors, especially those of the New Thought movement to which Atkinson belonged.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-Chapel2013-2) A modern Hermetic tract, it has been widely influential in [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age "New Age") circles since the twentieth century.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-3)

## Seven Hermetic principles\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Kybalion&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Seven Hermetic principles")\]

A central concept in the book is that there are "seven Hermetic principles, upon which the entire [Hermetic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism "Hermeticism") is based".[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-4) These are, as literally quoted from the book:

**1\. The principle of mentalism**

> "The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental."[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-5)

**2\. The principle of correspondence**

> "As above, so below; as below, so above.” \[...\] This principle embodies the truth that there is always a [correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_(theology) "Correspondence (theology)") between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of being and life.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-6)

**3\. The principle of vibration**

> "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-7)

**4\. The principle of polarity**

> "Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled."[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-8)

**5\. The principle of rhythm**

> "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates."[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-9)

**6\. The principle of cause and effect**

> "Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause; everything happens according to law; chance is but a name for law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the law."[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-10)

**7\. The principle of gender**

> "Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles; gender manifests on all planes."[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-11)

## Relation to ancient and medieval *Hermetica*\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Kybalion&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Relation to ancient and medieval Hermetica")\]

According to [Mitch Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Horowitz "Mitch Horowitz"), the [philosophical mentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalism_(philosophy) "Mentalism (philosophy)") (the primacy of mind as the active cause of things) described by the *Kybalion*'s first principle was inspired by broadly similar notions in the ancient Greek *[Hermetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetica "Hermetica")*.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-12)

Nicholas E. Chapel notes that while several aspects such as the philosophical mentalism, the concept of "[as above, so below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_above,_so_below "As above, so below")" as derived from the *[Emerald Tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Tablet "Emerald Tablet")*, and the idea that everything exists as pairs of gendered polar opposites, do have a background in ancient and medieval Hermetic texts, other aspects such as the principle of vibration (which originates in the philosophy of [David Hartley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hartley_(philosopher) "David Hartley (philosopher)"), 1705–1757) are not related to Hermeticism.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-Chapel2013-2)

Chapel also points out that there are a number of stark contrasts between the *Kybalion* and the traditional *Hermetica*, such as the *Kybalion*'s anti-theological stance versus the heavy emphasis on [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology") in the *Hermetica*, or the *Kybalion*'s focus on the practitioner's "mental transmutation" versus the *Hermetica*'s preoccupation with reverence for and [unification with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotheosis "Apotheosis") the divine. Chapel concludes that as a whole, the *Kybalion* is too bound up with early 20th-century ideas emanating from the [New Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Thought "New Thought") movement to be representative of the broader historical tradition of Hermetic philosophy.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion#cite_note-Chapel2013-2)
