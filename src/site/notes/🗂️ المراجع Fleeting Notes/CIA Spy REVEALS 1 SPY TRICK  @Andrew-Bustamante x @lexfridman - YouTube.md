Title: **(26) CIA Spy REVEALS #1 SPY TRICK | @Andrew-Bustamante x @lexfridman - YouTube**

- **Main Trick Revealed**: Perception vs. Perspective
  - Perception: Our personal interpretation of the world around us.
    - Unique to each individual.
    - Perception is often considered as reality.
    - No advantage in perception; leads to arguments.
  - Perspective: Observing the world from outside oneself.
    - Thinking like others gives informational advantage.
    - Enhances understanding and relationships.
    - People often trapped in their perception and don't think from a different perspective.

- **Applications**:
  - Using perspective can change career, marriage, family legacy.
  - Helps in understanding and connecting with others.

- **Empathy vs. Perspective**:
  - Empathy: Recognizing and understanding another's feelings.
  - Perspective goes beyond feelings; involves understanding objectives, aspirations, experiences, and actions.
  - Perspective involves understanding both the feelings (emotional aspect) and logic (rational aspect).

- **Importance of Connection**:
  - People desire community and understanding.
  - Practicing perspective validates a person's existence and experience.
  - Connection is intimate regardless of the relationship type (lovers, business, collaborators).

what is the one spy trick you would teach everyone that they can use to improve their life instantly now you already mentioned uh quite a few but what what else could jump to mind my go-to answer for this has not really changed much over the last few years so the the first the most important spy trick to change everything immediately is something called perception versus perspective we all look at the world through our own perception um my dad used to tell me my stepdad used to tell me that perception is reality and I I was I was arguing this

with him when I was 14 years old I told you so Dad you're still wrong yeah but perception is your interpretation of the world around you but it's Unique only to you there's no advantage in your perception that's why so many people find themselves arguing all the time trying to convince other people of their own perception the way that you win any argument the way that you get ahead in your career the way that you out sell or out race anybody is when you move off of perception and move into perspective

perspective is the act or the art of observing the world from outside of yourself whether that's outside of yourself as like an entity just observing in a third from a different point of view or even more powerful you sit in the shoes you sit in the seat of the person opposite you and you think to yourself what is their life like what do they feel right now uh you know are they comfortable are they uncomfortable are they afraid are they scared what are they what's the stressor that they woke up to this

morning what's the stressor that they're going to go to sleep with tonight when you shift places and get out of your own perception and into someone else's perspective now you're thinking like them which is giving you an informational Advantage but you know what they're all doing everyone else out there is trapped in their own perception not thinking about a different perspective so immediately you have Superior information Superior positioning you have an advantage that they don't have and if you do that to

your boss it's going to change your career if you do that to your spouse it's going to change your marriage if you do that to your kids it's going to change your family Legacy because nobody else out there is doing it it's so interesting how difficult empathy is for people and how powerful it is especially for for like you said the spouse like intimacy yeah like stepping outside of yourself and really putting yourself in the shoes of the other person considering how they see the world and that that that's uh I really enjoy that

because um how does that exactly lead to connection I I think when you start to understand the way the other person sees the world you start to enjoy the world through their eyes and you start to be able to share in terms of intimacy share the beauty that they see together because you understand their perspective and that's and somehow you converge as well of course that allows you to gather information better and all that kind of stuff and like that that allows you to work together better to uh share in all

different kinds of ways but for intimacy that's a really powerful thing and also for um actually like people you really disagree with or people on the internet you disagree with and so on I find empathy is is such a powerful way to uh resolve any tensions there even like people like trolls or all that kind of stuff I don't deride them I just kind of put myself in their shoes and it it becomes like an enjoyable uh camaraderie with that but what's that person so I want to draw a pretty hard line between

between perspective yeah and empathy because empathy is frankly an overused term um by people who don't really know what they're saying sometimes I think you know what you're saying but the vast majority of people listen I would uh secure that but that's fine as soon as you say empathy they're gonna just be like oh yeah I know I've heard this a thousand times yes empathy is about feeling what other people feel and or understanding you would just say yeah it's about feelings it's about

understanding someone else's feelings feeling uh it's not the same as sympathy where you feel their feelings empathy is about recognizing that they have feelings and recognizing that their feelings are valid perspective is more than just feelings it's about it's about the brain it's about the Pink Matter on the left side and the right side of the brain yes I care about feelings and this goes directly to your point about connection yes I care about feelings but I also care about objectives what is your life what is

your aspirational goal what was it like to grow up as you yeah what was it like to experience this and how did this shape your opinion on that and you know what uh what is it that you're going to do next more than just feelings actual tactical actions and that's that becomes extremely valuable in the operational world because if you can get into someone's head left brain and right brain feelings and logic you can start anticipating what actions they're going to take next you can direct the actions

that they're going to take next because you're basically telling them the story that's in their own head when it comes to relationships and personal connection we talked about it earlier the thing that people want the most is Community they want someone else who understands them they want to be with people they don't want to be alone the more you practice perspective empathy or no empathy the more you just validate that a person is there I am in this time and space with you in this moment feelings aside right

that is powerful that is intimate and when it's whether you're talking about lovers or whether you're talking about a business exchange or whether you're talking about collaborators in a crime I'm here with you ride or die let's do it if you like this short clip make sure you click here to see the next clip or here to see the full podcast episode \[Music\]
