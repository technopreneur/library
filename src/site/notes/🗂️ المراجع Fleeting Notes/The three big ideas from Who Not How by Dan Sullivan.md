**Hi I‚Äôm Steph, and each week I share the three big ideas from the best non-fiction books I‚Äôve been reading. This week, it‚Äôs Who Not How by Dan Sullivan and Dr Benjamin Hardy. You can also listen to me talk about this book on my podcast** [**Steph‚Äôs Business Bookshelf**](http://www.stephsbusinessbookshelf.com/)**.**

## **About the book**

What if everything you did was your choice, including how you spend your time, how much money you make, with whom you have relationships, and only doing work that aligns with your purpose?

Sound hard? It‚Äôs as simple as changing the core question you ask yourself.

When you want to accomplish something, stop asking, ‚ÄúHow can I do this?‚Äù

Legendary entrepreneur coach Dan Sullivan teaches you to ask instead, ‚ÄúWho can do this for me?‚Äù

This question at the heart of the Who Not How philosophy may seem simple, but don‚Äôt let the lack of complexity fool you. By mastering Who Not How, you will quickly learn how billionaires and successful entrepreneurs like Dan build incredible businesses and personal freedom, along with massive success.

## **Big Idea #1 ‚Äî Who not how**

Essentially, this is a book about delegation. Most of us, when faced with a challenge, ask ourselves, how will I do this? Whether it‚Äôs fixing our website planning meals for the week or booking a trip. But instead of asking *how* we should really be asking *who*. Because there is likely someone out there who can do it better, faster with less stress, more scale, and potentially cheaper, than we could do it ourselves.

This book itself is actually a *who not how* project. Benjamin Hardy saw Dan Sullivan speak about this concept at an event and Benjamin decided he wanted to write the book on it. He asked Dan and Dan let him.

Having this mindset of who not, how, as a default, allows you to create bigger things than you could do alone and focus on doing other things, which are maybe the things that you are better at.

Ultimately, it comes down to putting results above effort and working on tasks where you can get the better outcome, rather than necessarily where you can put the most effort in.

## **Big idea #2 ‚Äî Let the who do the how**

For this to work, you need to let the who do the how. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre there in the first place. You need to get out of their way and give them permission to do what it is that they do best.

Your role in the relationship is to set the vision. Dan actually uses something called an ‚Äòimpact filter‚Äô, this document covers why the particular project or the task is important, what the success criteria would look like, what‚Äôs at stake, and what could go wrong or any potential problems that might come up.

The book suggests looking at your goals for the next 90 days and running a ‚Äòwho audit‚Äô over them. Ask yourself who can help you achieve those goals? You could even do this on a weekly, or even a daily basis, using your to-do list and asking yourself who can help you.

## **Big idea #3 ‚Äî Freedom**

Freedom is one of the core ideas in the book. The book is structured around the four types of freedom you can access when you use this, who not how approach.

The four types of freedom are;

**Time** ‚Äî if you‚Äôre not doing something you free up your time to do other things.

**Money** ‚Äî yes, finding someone else to do those particular things might cost you money but you‚Äôre entering a different value exchange, as you‚Äôll free up your time to create more money by focusing on higher value activities

**Relationship** ‚Äî you can create transformational relationships by being a who to other people, as well and finding good who‚Äôs for yourself. You can then foster those relationships so that everyone ends up doing the work that is most valuable to them and allows them to operate at their best.

**Purpose** ‚Äî this allows you to do the bigger things you might want to do in life that maybe won‚Äôt happen otherwise, because you don‚Äôt have the skills or the time or the resources to do it.

There was a great example of freedom of purpose in the book. A lady called Karen wanted to write her grandmother‚Äôs biography. This was something that had been on her life to do list for a long time. Her grandmother was an important civil rights activist in the 1920s and actually helped get certain segregation laws changed in the USA. For Karen, this was a really important and very personal project.

Karen had started the book, had written some pages but had realised that writing a biography is almost like a full-time job in itself to do it well, especially if you are not an accomplished biographer. Karen had her own very busy job and therefore this biography wasn‚Äôt going very far, very fast.

Funnily enough, Karen was approached by another person who also wanted to research and write a book about Karen‚Äôs grandmother. This person was researching African-American civil rights activists and had come across Karen‚Äôs grandmother‚Äôs details and wanted Karen‚Äôs help in writing the book.

Karen‚Äôs initial response was one of threat. *She* wanted to the one to write the book about her grandmother, and saw this other woman as competition. However, after conversation with Benjamin, Karen realised that a collaboration with this biographer could actually mean the book got written. And likely to a higher quality, because the other person was an accomplished biographer and had published books previously. She realised that the purpose was sharing her grandmother‚Äôs story, *not* writing the book herself.
