in order to learn at any age the most

critical thing is that you bring as much

focus and active engagement to the
learning the encoding of the information

bringing in the information and then you

get into a state of deep rest as quickly

as possible typically that would be the

night after you learn after you have

this trigger but there are some

beautiful studies published in cell

reports last year and the year before

showing that people who take a 20-minute

nap within the four hours after these

triggering learning or people that do a

non-sleep deep rest type protocol even

just sitting there quietly and not doing

anything they learn much faster in other

words the brain rewires much faster it's

very interesting and what's happening

it's very interesting we've long known

that during sleep there's a replay of

the neurons in the same sequence that

they were played during the activity in

the earlier in that day sometimes even

backwards for some reason that it's like

the songs played backwards at night
