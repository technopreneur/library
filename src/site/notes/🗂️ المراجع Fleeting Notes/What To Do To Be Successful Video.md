and I would like think about this

because I'll tell you what it is that

you need to do to be successful some of

these things aren't so malleable but

others are things that you can work on

well IQ well that's a rough one

because there's no evidence as far as I

can tell that you can do a damn thing

about your IQ I was just reading a paper

by Dan Simon today it's a relatively

recent review Dan Simon did The

Invisible Gorilla stuff and he was

looking because there's all these

companies that claim that these online

brain training exercises can produce

cognitive improvements and he reviewed

the literature again I've reviewed that

literature like six times in the last 15

years because I keep hoping that someone

will crack the problem but it's always

the same answer it's like you do brain

training games you get better at the

game

a lot better at that game you get

slightly better at similar games but

distal games that are still heavily

cognitively loaded doesn't affect your

performance at all zero none

so the the issue of how to raise IQ man

that's a killer no one knows how to do

it I can tell you how to stop your IQ

from decreasing as you get older that's

not so bad because it does that fluid IQ

decreases from the time you're 20 and

and pretty rapidly it's uh physical

health is the best preventative so

exercise physical exercise weirdly

enough you know you think well why well

your brain uses oxygen like mad right

and it and it needs to be kept clean and

well oxygenated and physical exercise

both

both like weight lifting so anaerobic

anaerobic

anaerobic and aerobic exercise both seem

to be very very effective at staving off

cognitive declines across the lifespan

so that's a really useful thing to know

because that's the only thing we know

that does that so then the next best

predictor of Lifetime success is

conscientiousness well so and of the of

the two aspects of conscientiousness say

orderliness and and industriousness the

better predictor is industriousness so

the question is well what can you do

about your industriousness and the

answer to that is

well that's kind of rough too because

there's a strong genetic component but

you can work on micro habits with

regards to your conscientiousness and I

think the best micro habits this is

partly to do with this future authoring

program processes I think the best thing

you can do with regards to your

conscientiousness is to set up some aims

for yourself goals that you actually

value and the future authoring program

helps people do that and basically it

does a situational analysis of it helps

you do a situational analysis of your

life more than a psychological analysis

I would say and so so the questions are

something like well all right you're

going to have to put some effort into

your life

and you need to be motivated to do that

and so what are the potential sources of

motivation well you could think about

them in in the big five manner you know

if you're extroverted you want friends

if you're agreeable you want an intimate

relationship if you're disagreeable you

want to win competitions if you're open

you want to engage in Creative activity

if you're high neuroticism you want

security okay so those are all sources

of potential motivation that you could

draw on that you could tailor to your

own you know your own personality but

then there are dimensions that you want

to consider your life across and so we

ask people about well you know if you

could have your life the way you wanted

it in three to five years if you were

taking care of yourself properly you

know what would you want from your

friendships what would you want from

your intimate relationship how would you

like to structure your family what do

you want for your career well how are

you going to use your time outside of

your job and how are you going to

regulate your mental physical mental and

physical health and maybe also your drug

and alcohol use because that's that's a

good place to Auger down you know

because alcoholism for example wipes out

you know five to ten percent of people

so you want to keep that under control

and then

and then so maybe you know you you you

develop a vision of what your life what

you would like your life to be and that

Associates

the so the goal once the goal is

established and then you break down the

goal into micro processes that you can

implement the microprocesses become

rewarding in proportion in relation to

their uh causal association with the

goal and that tangles in your your

incentive reward system you know we

talked about the dopaminergic incentive

reward system and that's the thing that

keeps you moving forward and the way it

works is that it works better if it

produces positive emotion when it can

see you moving towards a valued goal

okay well what's the implication of that

better have a valued goal because

otherwise you can't get any positive

motivation working out and so the more

valuable the goal in principle the more

the micro processes associated with that

goal start to take on a positive charge

and so what that means is well you get

up in the morning and you're excited

about the day you're ready to go and so

as far as I can tell what you do is you

specify your long-term ideal

maybe you also specify a place you want

to stay the hell away from so that

you're terrified to fail as well as

excited about succeeding because that's

also useful you specify your goal you do

that you do that in some sense as a

unique individual you want to you want

to specify goals that make you say oh if

that could happen as a consequence of my

efforts it would clearly be worthwhile

because the question always is why do

something because doing nothing is easy

you just sit there and you don't do

anything that's real easy the question

is why would you ever do anything and

the answer to that has to be because

you've determined by some means that

it's worthwhile and then the next

question might be well where should you

look for worthwhile things and one would

be well you could consult your own

temperament and the other would be well

you kind of look at how look at what it

is that people accrue that's valuable

across the lifespan look look what so

you do a structural analysis of the

sub-components of human existence and

already did that you need a family you

need friends right like you don't need

to have all these things but you better

have most of them family friends career

educational goals plans for you know

time outside of work

attention to your mental and physical

health Etc you know those are that's

what life is about and if you don't have

any of those things well then all you've

got left is misery and suffering so

that's that's a bad

that's a bad deal for you

so

so once but once you set up that that

goal structure let's say and that's

really in many in many ways that's what

you should be doing at universities is

that's exactly what you should be doing

is trying to figure out

who it is that you're trying to be

right and you aim at that and then use

everything you learn as a means of

building that person that you want to be

and

and I really mean want to be I don't

mean should be even those things those

things are going to overlap and it's

important to distinguish between those

because that's partly and this is back

down to the micro routine analysis so as

I was saying well you're going to try to

make yourself more industrious okay

number one specify your damn goals

because how are you going to hit

something if you don't know what it is

that isn't going to happen and often

people won't specify their goals too

because they don't like to specify

conditions for failure so if you keep

yourself all vague and foggy which is

real easy because that's just a matter

of not doing as well then you don't know

when you fail

and people might say well I really don't

want to know when I fail because that's

painful so I'll keep myself blind about

when I fail that's fine except you'll

fail all the time then you just won't

know it until you've failed so badly

that you're done and that can easily

happen by the time you're 40.

so so I would recommend that you don't

let that happen so that's willful

blindness right you could have known but

you chose not to okay so once you get

your goal structure set up you think

okay if I could have this life it looks

like that might be worth living despite

the fact that it's going to be you know

anxiety provoking and threatening and

there's going to be some suffering and

loss involved in all of that obviously

the goal is to to have a vision for your

life such that all things considered

that justifies your effort okay so then

what do you do

well then then you turn down to the

micro routines it's like okay well this

is what I'm aiming for how does that

instantiate itself day to day week to

week month to month and that's where

something like a schedule can be

unbelievably useful Google Calendar it's

like make a damn schedule and stick to

it okay so what's the rule with the

schedule it's not a bloody prison

that's the first thing that people do

wrong they say well I don't like to have

follow a schedule it's like well what

kind of schedule are you setting up well

I have to do this then I have to do this

then I have to do this you know and then

I just go play video games because who

wants to do all these things that I have

to do it's like wrong set the damn

schedule up

so that you have the day you want that's

the trick it's like okay I've got

tomorrow if I was going to set it up so

it was the best possible day I could

have

practically speaking what would it look

like

well then you schedule that and

obviously there's a bit of

responsibility that's going to go along

with that because if you have any sense

one of the things that you're going to

insist upon is that at the end of the

day you're not in worse shape than you

were that then at the beginning of the

day right because that's a stupid day if

you have a bunch of those in a row you

just dig you know you dig yourself a

hole and then you bury yourself in it's

like sorry that's just not a good

strategy it's a bad strategy so maybe 20

percent of your day has to be

responsibility and obligation or maybe

it's more than that depending on how far

behind you are but even that you can you

can ask yourself okay well I've got

these responsibilities I have to

schedule the damn things in what's the

right ratio of responsibility to reward

and you can ask yourself that just like

you'd negotiate with someone who is

working for you it's like okay you got

to work tomorrow

okay so I want you to work tomorrow and

you might say okay well what are you

going to do for me

that makes it likely that I'll work for

you well you could ask yourself that you

know so maybe you do an hour of of

responsibility and then you play a video

game for 15 minutes I don't know

whatever turns your crank man but you

know you have to negotiate with yourself

and not tyrannize yourself like you're

negotiating with someone that you care

for that you would like to be productive

and have a good life and and that's how

you make the schedule it's like and then

you look at the day and you think well

if I had that day that'd be good great

you know and you you're useless and

horrible so you'll probably only hit it

with about 70 percent accuracy but that

beats the hell out of zero

right and if you hit it even with 50

accuracy another rule is well aim for 51

the next week or 50 and a half percent

for God's sake or because you're you're

going to hit that position where things

start to loop back positively and spiral

you upward and so

so that's one way that you can work on

your conscientiousness is plan a life

you'd like to have and and you do that

partly by referring to social norms

that's more or less rescuing your father

from the belly of the whale but the way

other way you do that is by having a

little conversation with yourself about

as if you don't really know who you are

because you know what you like you won't

do what you're told you won't do what

you tell yourself to do you must have

noticed that it's like you're a bad

employee and a worse boss and both of

those work

you know for you you don't know what you

want to do and then when you tell

yourself what to do you don't do it

anyways you should fire yourself and

find someone else to be
