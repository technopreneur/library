> “I will relate the history of the next two centuries. I describe what is coming, what cannot be changed: the advent of nihilism. For some time now, our whole European culture has been moving toward a catastrophe, with a tortured tension that is growing from decade to decade: relentlessly, violently, headlong, like a river that wants to reach the end, that no longer reflects, that is afraid to reflect.” — [The Will to Power, Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/730395-for-some-time-now-our-whole-european-culture-has-been)

It was only in the mid-19th century that the term nihilism began to be widely used in the West, despite nihilism’s philosophical roots stretching back thousands of years.

Ivan Turgenev’s novel Fathers and Sons, published in 1862, is often credited with inspiring the term’s popularization. An important character in the story is asked what it means to be a nihilist, and he replies:

> “\[a\] nihilist is a man who does not bow down before any authority, who does not take any principle on faith, whatever reverence that principle may be enshrined in.” — [Fathers and Sons, Ivan Turgenev](https://www.verbalworkout.com/u/u143/u116439.htm)

Currently, the use of the term in Fathers and Sons would be considered political nihilism — rejecting society’s norms and institutions.

Since the publication of this novel, many writers and philosophers have argued for nihilistic views, resulting in growing ambiguity in the meaning of the term.

Let’s clarify:

## Nihilism Definitions

Nihilism can be divided into four main types, all of which share a common characteristic, namely an attitude of denial or negation.

Moral nihilism, epistemological nihilism, and cosmic nihilism are the first three types of nihilism. Each of them strips meaning away from an essential area of life in which humans have traditionally looked for it.

Throughout history, people have assumed that purpose must have an objective basis. It is difficult to avoid nihilism when one denies there is an objective or absolute basis for value, truth, or meaning.

Nihilism rejects the objectivity of ethical principles by claiming that they cannot be judged as true or false but are subjective and thus meaningless.  
One is likely to reach existential nihilism, the fourth type, if one accepts these first three types of nihilism.

Existential nihilism encompasses those three types since when one denies meaning in life, one implicitly or explicitly denies meaning in each of the three previously mentioned areas.

It is more likely that one will become an existential nihilist and claim life is meaningless and absurd if one denies the existence of moral principles and truths, and believes that the universe is indifferent to human hopes and concerns, or even hostile to them.

Nietzsche was most interested in existential nihilism, which is usually referred to when the term nihilism is used on its own.

Nihilism usually raises the question, what does it mean to negate meaning? Understanding what the word “meaning” actually means is essential to clarify this issue.

According to the philosopher David Roochnick in his book *Retrieving the Ancients: An Introduction to Greek Philosophy*, the word “meaning” can refer to two different things: “to signify,” as in “pigs are four-legged mammals usually found on farms,” or “to intend or have a purpose,” as in “I meant it.”

Using these definitions, he suggests that to believe that human life has meaning is to believe that “life has a purpose that can be signified or explained.”

Life is not meaningful just because it has a purpose if no one knows what that purpose is. People must be able to recognize a purpose with life for it to have meaning.

## The Sense of Meaning

Is there a reason humans need a sense of meaning in their lives?

As with many philosophical questions, there is no clear consensus on the source of the seemingly universal need for purpose among humans.

Schopenhauer, whose philosophy greatly influenced Nietzsche, suggested that the certainty of suffering combined with the inescapability of death creates the desire in human beings for meaning.

Leaving that issue aside, another question needs to be asked: Where do humans typically find meaning?

The purpose of life has traditionally been in another reality, as strange as that may sound. There is a belief that this alternate reality, sometimes known as the ‘true world,’ is the source of truth and value and that it is a destination, with the purpose of life being to enter or access this alternate world either after death or during one’s lifetime.

Those theories that propose an alternate world as the source of meaning are called two-world theories.

## Theories That Gave Meaning

For thousands of years, two world theories have dominated thought, providing meaning to countless individuals.

Plato’s world of forms and Christianity’s heaven are examples of two-world theories.

Over the course of nearly 2000 years, the Christian heaven has been the most prominent two-world theory in the West. People who followed Christian teachings believed that their lives were for something, no matter how difficult they lives were; that is, there was a purpose to their earthly existence, and that purpose was to live according to God’s will so that when they died, they would be able to enter the kingdom of heaven.

As a powerful ‘antidote’ to nihilism, this ‘story’ ensures that the believer, regardless of how much suffering they endure in this life, will be guaranteed entry to a blissful reality upon their death, a much-desired purpose and meaning to life.

There would be no nihilism as long as one believes that there is a meaning or purpose to life, regardless of how much suffering and pain one endures in life. It is clear to see the reason why Christianity was amazingly popular in the West: The conviction that no matter how much suffering and evil one endured in their lifetime, one’s life would still have a purpose.

## The Origins of Nihilism

Nihilism has roots that go well beyond the advent of the modern era.

Many ancient writers, including the Greek poet Theognis, who lived in the sixth century BC, expressed pessimism toward the meaning of life, which was considered the beginning of nihilism by Nietzsche:

> “Not to have been born at all,  
> Never to have seen the light of the sun:  
> This is the best thing for mortals.  
> Or, if begotten, to have fallen from the womb  
> Straight into the grave,  
> And to be smothered, unknowing,  
> In the dirt of Hades.” — [Theognis, poems](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7584155-not-to-have-been-born-at-all-never-to-have)

For the time being, it was Christianity that provided Western civilization with that answer to the question, ‘what is the meaning of life?’ But is well known that the role Christianity played in the Western world began to falter in the 16th and 17th centuries.

In his book *The Gay Science*, Nietzsche reiterates the idea that science and meaninglessness are inextricably linked:

> “A “scientific” interpretation of the world, as you understand, might, therefore, still be one of the most stupid of all possible interpretations of the world, meaning that it would be one of the poorest in meaning. This thought is intended for the ears and consciences of our mechanists who nowadays like to pass as philosophers and insist that mechanics is the doctrine of the first and last laws on which all existence must be based as on the ground floor. But an essentially mechanical world would be an essentially meaningless world.”

Nietzsche continues:

> “Assuming that one estimated the value of a piece of music according to how much of it could be counted, calculated, and expressed in formulas: how absurd would such a “scientific” estimation of music be! What would one have comprehended, understood, grasped of it? nothing, really nothing of what is “music” in it!” —[The Gay Science, Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/nietzsches-final-teaching-by-michael-allen-gillespie-chicago-university-of-chicago-press-2017-264p-3500-cloth/D0ED0BC646DBB8939C7A02A1F393A49E)

Another philosopher, Giordano Bruno, despite his apparent pantheistic view, has thought on a theory that, inadvertently, also helped to give fuel to nihilism.

During the late 16th century, he combined Copernicus’ heliocentric view of the universe with Nicholas of Cusa’s infinity, adding up to the beliefs of the pre-Socratic philosophers Leucippus and Democritus concerning atoms.

In his theory, Bruno asserted that the sun was but a single star within an infinite universe of stars and that the sun was only one of the millions of stars scattered throughout that universe.

It has also been proposed by Bruno that some of these stars may have other planets in their orbit which might be able to support life similar to the planet Earth.

The concept of an infinite universe with infinite stars, thus, infinite ‘centers’, deeply conflicts with the Christian concept of man being the center of the universe.

Although science provided answers to many practical questions and improved life in unexpected ways, it did not contribute to the meaning and purpose of life, unlike religion. It merely cast doubt on Christianity and other religions by instigating a skeptical attitude.

Nietzsche seems to have foreshadowed the growing wave of nihilism that would grip Western society, particularly after World War I, when it played an important role in the philosophy of modern philosophers as Bertrand Russell, John Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, among others.

Until the death of God, he understood that Christianity had so far provided individuals with the conviction that life had meaning, and with ‘the death of god,’ a gnawing feeling of meaninglessness would grip every individual with ever-increasing intensity.

As in the opening of this article, the modern era would be defined by how this feeling was dealt with and eventually overcome.
