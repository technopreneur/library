## Abstract

The *generation effect* is a robust memory phenomenon in which actively producing material during encoding acts to improve later memory performance. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis, we explored the neural basis of this effect. During encoding, participants generated synonyms from word-fragment cues (e.g., GARBAGE–W\_ST\_) or read other synonym pairs (e.g., GARBAGE–WASTE). Compared to simply reading target words, generating target words significantly improved later recognition memory performance. During encoding, this benefit was associated with a broad [neural network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neural-networks "Learn more about neural network from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that involved both prefrontal (inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus) and posterior cortex (inferior [temporal gyrus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/temporal-gyrus "Learn more about temporal gyrus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), lateral [occipital cortex](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/occipital-lobe "Learn more about occipital cortex from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), [parahippocampal gyrus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/parahippocampal-gyrus "Learn more about parahippocampal gyrus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), ventral posterior parietal cortex). These findings define the prefrontal-posterior cortical dynamics associated with the mnemonic benefits underlying the generation effect.

    To our knowledge, only two studies have directly explored the neural basis of the generation effect \[9,10\]. Rosner et al. \[9\] compared fMRI activity when participants had to encode cue-target synonyms either by reading them (e.g. GARBAGE-WASTE) or by generating them from word-fragment cues (e.g. GARBAGE-W\_ST\_). Their memory for target words was then assessed using a recognition memory task including confidence ratings (high vs. low).

    The fMRI findings related to selective retrieval and inhibition processes are mixed. There is evidence that the VLPFC and the ACC are more involved during practice-testing than restudying \[26–29\], and several studies demonstrated a link between activity in the VLPFC and the ACC and later memory performance at final test, but the direction of this link differed among studies. Moreover, different effects of prior testing on VLPFC and ACC activations during the final test suggest a differential role of these two areas during testing.

    Using the self-generation encoding task also used in the present study, we previously found increased activation for self-generation encoding of words compared to reading in inferior/middle frontal gyri, anterior cingulate, caudate nucleus, and the temporo-parietal–occipital junction bilaterally (Vannest et al., 2012). A largely overlapping pattern of results was recently observed by Rosner et al. in another similar self-generation task (Rosner et al., 2013). On the whole, these studies support a frontal–temporal–occipital network that is necessary for successful verbal encoding.

    Specifically, AG activity was negatively correlated with subsequent memory when items were presented, but it became positively correlated with memory immediately after presentations when cued to remember. Positive SMEs during the cue phase suggests that the AG is involved in elaborative encoding, such as self-generation or retrieval practice, which are known to enhance subsequent memory (Rosner et al., 2013). Although we observed positive SMEs in the AG immediately following stimulus presentations, we suggest that anytime after perceptual processing when a prior experience is retrieved, replayed, or re-analyzed, vPPC regions are involved in consolidating or cortically binding features of that experience.
