**Voluntarism** is "any metaphysical or psychological system that assigns to the [will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_(philosophy) "Will (philosophy)") ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"): *voluntas*) a more predominant role than that attributed to the [intellect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellect "Intellect")",[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-Brit-1) or equivalently "the doctrine that will is the basic factor, both in the universe and in human conduct".[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-2) Voluntarism has appeared at various points throughout the history of philosophy, seeing application in the areas of [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), [political philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy") and [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology").

The term voluntarism was introduced by [Ferdinand Tönnies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_T%C3%B6nnies "Ferdinand Tönnies") into the philosophical literature and particularly used by [Wilhelm Wundt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt "Wilhelm Wundt") and [Friedrich Paulsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Paulsen "Friedrich Paulsen").

## Theological voluntarism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voluntarism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Theological voluntarism")\]

### Medieval theological voluntarism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voluntarism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Medieval theological voluntarism")\]

Associated with [Duns Scotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duns_Scotus "Duns Scotus") and [William of Ockham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham "William of Ockham")[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-3) (two of the foremost medieval [scholastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism "Scholasticism") philosophers), **medieval theological voluntarism** (not to be confused with [meta-ethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethical "Meta-ethical") [theological voluntarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_voluntarism "Theological voluntarism")) is generally taken to be the philosophical emphasis on the divine will and human freedom over and above the intellect (*voluntas superior intellectu*). For example, Scotus held that morality comes from God's will and choice rather than his intellect or knowledge. Accordingly, God should be defined as an [omnipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence "Omnipotence") being whose actions should not and cannot be ultimately rationalized and explained through reason. As such, voluntarism is usually contrasted with [intellectualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism "Intellectualism"), championed by the [scholastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism "Scholasticism") [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas").[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-4)

### Theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voluntarism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy")\]

**Theological voluntarism** also refers to theological commitments—that is, specific interpretations of doctrines of Christianity—arguably held by certain early modern natural philosophers such as [Pierre Gassendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gassendi "Pierre Gassendi"), [Walter Charleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Charleton "Walter Charleton"), [Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle"),[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-5) [Isaac Barrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Barrow "Isaac Barrow") and [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"). It resulted in an empirical approach associated with early modern science. Voluntarism therefore allows that faith or belief in God can be achieved by will as opposed to requiring a prior divine gift of faith to the individual. This notion holds at least in so far as it has found favor among some historians and philosophers (e.g. the historian [Francis Oakley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Oakley "Francis Oakley") and the philosopher [Michael B. Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_B._Foster "Michael B. Foster")).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-6) A 20th-century theologian of voluntarism was [James Luther Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Luther_Adams "James Luther Adams").

## Metaphysical voluntarism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voluntarism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Metaphysical voluntarism")\]

A proponent of **metaphysical voluntarism** is 19th-century German philosopher [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer "Arthur Schopenhauer").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-Brit-1) In his view, the will is not reasoning, but an irrational, unconscious urge in relation to which the intellect represents a secondary phenomenon. The will is actually the force at the core of all reality. This putting out of the drive–intention–vital dynamics later influenced [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche "Friedrich Nietzsche") ([will to power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power "Will to power")), [Philipp Mainländer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Mainl%C3%A4nder "Philipp Mainländer") (will to die), [Eduard von Hartmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_von_Hartmann "Eduard von Hartmann"), [Julius Bahnsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Bahnsen "Julius Bahnsen") and [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud") ([will to pleasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_principle_(psychology) "Pleasure principle (psychology)")).

## Epistemological voluntarism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voluntarism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Epistemological voluntarism")\]

In [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"), **epistemological voluntarism**[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-7) is the view that belief is a matter of the will rather than one of simply registering one's cognitive attitude or degree of psychological certainty with respect to a stated proposition. If one is a voluntarist with respect to beliefs, it is coherent to simultaneously feel very certain about a particular proposition P and assign P a very low subjective probability. This is the basis of [Bas van Fraassen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas_van_Fraassen "Bas van Fraassen")'s [reflection principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Fraassen%27s_reflection_principle "Van Fraassen's reflection principle").

## Political voluntarism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voluntarism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Political voluntarism")\]

**Political voluntarism**, or [voluntaryism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism "Voluntaryism"), is the view that understands political authority to be will-based. This view which was propounded by theorists like [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes "Thomas Hobbes"), [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau "Jean-Jacques Rousseau") and many members of the [German idealist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_idealist "German idealist") tradition understands political authority as emanating from a will.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-8)

In [Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist "Marxist") discourse, voluntarism was used to designate a connection between a philosophical commitment to metaphysical voluntarism (especially [Machism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machism "Machism")) and a political commitment to extreme revolutionary tactics, particularly associated with [Alexander Bogdanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bogdanov "Alexander Bogdanov").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-9) Today, most self-identified voluntaryists are [libertarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism "Libertarianism").

## Critical voluntarism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voluntarism_(philosophy)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Critical voluntarism")\]

[Hugo Dingler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Dingler "Hugo Dingler")'s **critical voluntarism** in the [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science") is a form of [conventionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventionalism "Conventionalism") which posits that theorizing in the sciences starts with an unavoidable free decision of the will.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)#cite_note-10) The successor school of Dingler's critical voluntarism is the methodical [constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivist_epistemology "Constructivist epistemology") of the [Erlangen School](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erlangen_School_of_constructivism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Erlangen School of constructivism (page does not exist)") (cf. also the [methodical culturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodical_culturalism "Methodical culturalism") of the [Marburg School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marburg_School "Marburg School")).
