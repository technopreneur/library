Nietzsche’s quote -designed By [Som Dutt](https://somdutt777.medium.com/) on [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/)

Friedrich Nietzsche is best known for his critique of Christianity and Western civilization. In the late 1800s, Nietzsche predicted the rise of nihilism in Europe.

Nietzsche believed that the world was constantly changing and that traditional values no longer held true.

He thought that people had become too reliant on reason and science, and as a result, had lost touch with their emotions and creativity. This would eventually lead to the downfall of European civilization.

This article looks at Nietzsche’s thoughts on nihilism and how it applies to contemporary Europe. This article looks at how his views apply to the current state of Europe.

## What Nietzsche Meant When He Said:

> **He that speaks here, conversely, has done nothing so far but reflect: a philosopher and solitary by instinct, who has found his advantage in standing aside and outside, in patience, in procrastination, in staying behind; as a spirit of daring and experiment that has already lost its way once in every labyrinth of the future; as a soothsayer-bird spirit who looks back when relating what will come; as the first perfect nihilist of Europe who, however, has even now lived through the whole of nihilism, to the end, leaving it behind, outside himself.  
> \-The Will To Power**

## Meaning, Summary And Explanation

First, let’s see the context of this quote. This is from Nietzsche’s book, The Will To Power.

The quote is in relation to his thoughts on the decline of western culture. He thought that at that time all of humanity was suffering from a sort of nihilism after the sense of **“God is Dead”**.

He believed that western culture is declining because people are losing their connection to the values and morals that have made their civilization great.

People are more concerned with having money, fame and material wealth. They are losing their sense of meaning and purpose in their lives.

Their morality is becoming more and more corrupt, and more and more people are committing immoral acts.

According to Nietzsche, this is the perfect time for a philosopher to speak out. He is doing so in order to prevent people from becoming nihilists.

He is also doing this to prevent nihilism from spreading into the world. He feels that it is easier to prevent the spread of nihilism than to cure it.

People see no use in life, and they lose their sense of purpose and meaning.

It is this sense of meaning and purpose that makes a culture great. It’s what makes life worthwhile. If there is no sense of meaning and purpose in life, then life becomes meaningless and empty. People would rather do anything than face this reality.

Nietzsche believed that our western society is on the verge of losing its values, with all that this entails. We are constantly bombarded with news of violence, poverty and natural disasters. As a result, it can be easy to lose faith in humanity and give up on trying to make things better.

We are losing touch with the things that give life meaning. In our society, we have lost the values that we once had, and are now in a state of nihilism.

Nietzsche believed that this was due to the rise of modern science, which has destroyed the traditional arts and led to a feeling of meaninglessness.

The reason for this is that modern science can explain everything and can tell us what is true and what is not. This can make us feel isolated from the natural world, and we lose our sense of purpose.

People are constantly bombarded with harsh truths — the inevitability of death, the vastness of time and space, and the cruelty of life.

I think this is a very insightful quote. It represents so much of what Nietzsche wanted to convey. He was a very pessimistic and melancholic philosopher about the future of western culture, but he was also very inspired and creative.

Instead, he said that you should be prepared to live in a world that is going to be very brutal. There will no happy endings.

He said that life was too hard to be easy and that you should make the most of it because you would never have another opportunity to live and you had to endure it. Because of this, he wanted to create a world that was filled with beauty, with a sense of awe in the face of the horror that the world brings.

This is why Nietzsche feels that a philosopher must speak out. It’s important to be able to show people the truth about life. It’s important to help people understand what is really going on in the world.

## Nietzsche: Decline Of Contemporary Europe!

Nietzsche believed that this sense of nihilism would eventually lead to the collapse of European civilization.

Nietzsche’s ideas on nihilism have had a huge impact on modern art and philosophy. As a philosophy, nihilism is often associated with existentialism. This is because when you think about nihilism, you are usually focusing on the idea of an absence of meaning or goals.

But with existentialism, nihilism has a different meaning. It is the idea that there are no real values in life and so we should make the most of whatever we have and not worry about the future.

Nietzsche did feel that modern life would be a nihilistic one, where there was no value in anything or anyone. This caused him to feel that we should strive to live in accordance with the values that we know to be true.

He believed that this was the only way to escape what he called “The tyranny of the bad conscience.”

This felt that we must strive to find the values that can be true for us, even if they are impossible for others.

Nietzsche believed that the only way to escape the tyranny of the bad conscience was to create art. He felt that creating things that we value is the only way to truly give ourselves meaning in life.

This is the reason why he felt that we should strive to create art. He believed that art is one of the few things that will always be around and that it will remain an important part of anyone’s life.

However, Nietzsche’s idea of the nihilism of contemporary Europe is still relevant today.

## Final Thought on Nietzsche: Nihilism & Decline Of Contemporary Europe

Friedrich Nietzsche has some interesting thoughts on the nihilism of contemporary Europe. He believed that the loss of meaning and values in society had led to a sense of nihilism, or nothingness.

This is especially evident in the way that people have become more individualistic and self-centred. This sense of nihilism will eventually lead to the collapse of European civilization.

He thought that nihilism was a result of the loss of religious and moral values in contemporary Europe.

Nietzsche thought that nihilism was a dangerous belief because it could lead to despair and nihilistic acts, such as suicide.

Nietzsche believed that European aristocracy was decadent and that democracy would lead to the massification of culture. As a result, he argued, Europe would become increasingly nihilistic.

Nietzsche believed that this crisis could only be overcome through a radical revaluation of values, which he sees as the task of his generation.
