the world right and that's actually a

positive part of their development it's

a stage that the developmental

psychologist Jean Piaget called the

messianic stage and he associated that

with late adolescence

it's like while young people want to

change the world the problem is is that

that's being harnessed into attempts to

change other people but that isn't what

you should do if you want to change the

world you should change yourself and I

don't mean that some cliched sense I

mean it in the sense that Alexander

Solzhenitsyn said when he analyzed the

Soviet Union he said don't be thinking

that the line that divides good from

evil runs down a political spectrum or

or countries or something like that it

runs down right down the middle of your

soul and if you want to sort out the

world and what you do is you sort

yourself out it's a serious business

right they say it's more difficult to

rule yourself than to rule a city and

that's the truth because you're a

complicated and there are horrible

monsters inside of you that need to be

tamed and to be brought and to be

brought into alignment and submission so

that you can be US powerful and useful

person and I gave away the future

authoring program as part of this video

I made suggesting to Millennials that

instead of rushing out there to change

the world by changing other bad people

that they should look inward and sort

themselves out properly and I think

we've given away about four or five

thousand of those programs so far I said

rows about three to the end of November

and what happens with it it's well the

self or the future authoring program is

regularly $14.95 and the whole self

authoring suite which involves it's a

program that helps you write an

autobiography so it helps you sort out

things about your past that are still

burdening you you can tell a if if you

have a memory that's more than 18 months

old

approximately and when you pull that

memory up to mind if you still have an

emotional reaction that means you

haven't fully articulated the memory you

haven't analyzed it causally you haven't

you haven't freed yourself from its

grasp and you're carrying it like a

weight and your brain responds to that

like the more of more weight you're

carrying like that more baggage let's

say the more of the stress hormone

cortisol your brain produces and

cortisol makes you old some of this work

has been done by James Panama

at the University of Texas at Austin

because he he started to pioneer these

sorts of writing programs and he found

that if people wrote about uncertain

things past present or future so they

could be traumatic things they could be

uncertain things that their physical

health improved and he he did a lot of

detailed research trying to figure out

why that was and basically came down to

the explanation that it was something

like an uncertainty reduction mechanism

at work because your brain is always

figuring out how well situated are you

in the world

how much do you not know compared to how

much have you mastered and you can tell

that you've mastered things because when

you go somewhere and you act things turn

out the way you want them that's an

indication of mastery and your brain is

sort of keeping track across your whole

life of how many places you've been

where things haven't worked out compared

to how many places you have been where

they have worked out and if all those

places in your past where things haven't

worked out you need to map and master

and that that decreases the existential

load on you but that actually decreases

your psychophysiological load it makes

you healthier it makes you less stress

and so we put all that together in this

self authoring suite to help people

write about their past to sort it out in

a in a detailed autobiography to ask you

questions about your past it says divide

your life up into six epochs and then

divide each of those that might be say

old birth to kindergarten and then maybe

elementary school and then maybe junior

high school however you want to do it

and then to write about the emotionally

significant events in each of those

epochs and then to describe their

effects on you and then to analyze how

you did in those situations what you

might have done differently what you

might have do differently in the future

to straighten out your past and I've

done that with my students in my maps of

meeting class for about the last ten

years and some people have written

15,000 words it's not that uncommon for

students to write 15,000 words in their

autobiography Wow so that's such great

advice that's such great advice about

reconciling with your past because so

many people just carry it around yeah

well if you're if you're thinking about

your past what it means is you haven't

analyzed the causal chains because you

might say well why do you remember your

past well you might say well it's in

order to have an

you know record of the past it's like it

has nothing to do with that there's only

one reason you remember the past and

that's to be prepared for the future

that's why you remember the past and so

what you're supposed to do is take the

past and extract out from it wisdom and

wisdom is the ability to avoid stumbling

blindly into ditches and so you think

well here's a time in my past I stumbled

blindly into this horrible ditch and

terrible things happen to me it's like

okay you need to take that apart you

need to figure out how was it that that

events conspired with your participation

voluntarily or involuntarily so that

that terrible consequence emerged you

need to know why that happened and how

you could react differently in that

situation and as soon as you do that

your brain will leave it alone you won't

obsess you about it anymore because the

anxiety-producing parts of your brain

are basically trying to tell you where

there are obstacles in your environment

it's like look out don't go there don't

go there it's like well don't go there

there's fire well maybe you could master

the fire right then you're a wielder a

fire you're not just a victim and loss

of situations our dangers are not

dangerous depending on your level of

mastery right life is like that and so a

negative emotion that's associated with

a memory is is something that's crying

out for mastery and writing can really

help with that so you're reorganizing

your brain when you write

autobiographically

you're basically the emotions imagine

emotion memories can be stored at

different levels of your brain some from

sort of primordial reptilian image Laden

areas that are very emotional up to

finally articulated plans for your

future life well you want to take

everything that's negative and emotional

and transform that into a fully

articulated vision for your future and

that frees you of your past you

shouldn't be thinking about your past I

mean maybe if you're 80 and you know

you're going over a well-spent life

that's a little different thing but if

you're thirty thirty-five or twenty and

most of the time you're thinking about

your past it's like it's like your soul

is trapped back there

you need to you need to free it through

investigation and the metaphysical

language is appropriate because that is

in the sense what you're doing you're

trapped in the past it's like you got to

break free of that so you can use all

your resources to move ahead into the

future anyways in these programs the

future authoring program like I said has

had walloping effects on people it's

that's fantastic advice I mean it's just

so it's so logical and it sounds so

great

I mean
