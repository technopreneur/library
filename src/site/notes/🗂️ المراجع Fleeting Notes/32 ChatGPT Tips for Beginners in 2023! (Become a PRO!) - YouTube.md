in this video we are going to be diving into 32 tips and tricks within chat GPT so that by the end of this video if you are a beginner you will be a chat gbt Pro so grab your notepads and your iced coffees and let's get right into this chat gbt tip number one is to assign roles to chat gbt before typing off your question or your command now when you assign a role to chat gbt you give it a personality or a Persona to act like and then every time chat gbt responds to you after your question or command it will

act in the Persona that you gave it let me show you what I'm talking about so before assigning a rule to chat gbt your prompts might look like this write a small birthday letter to my cousin Timmy now when I send off this message Chad gbt will do just that it will write a little birthday letter to your cousin Timmy well now let's assign a role to chat gbt in order to spice up our creative writing and whenever you're assigning a role always start with act as I'm going to keep this one simple act

as a pirate and then we have our prompt of write a small birthday letter to my cousin Timmy now when I hit save and submit it will talk as if it is a pirate and use completely different verbiage than the first letter just because we gave it that system role to play I mean just look at the difference in the first sentence in this one it says happy birthday I hope this letter finds you full of joy and excitement on your special day and if we compare that to the role of a pirate that we gave Chad gbt it now says Avast it's a special day

on the horizon for tis your birthday me Hardy this is an awesome way to mix up your prompts and it goes so much more in depth than just telling Chad jbt to act like a pirate if you want to see how you can create your own personas in the prompt formula in order to create good personas you can watch my video I have on assigning roles to Jazzy BT right up there jgbt tip number two is to format your outputs jet GPT does not have to respond to you in the form of plain text you can have it respond to you in code tables numbered list bullet list comma

separated values the list goes on so here's a quick example of formatting your text in a table rather than plain text so I say say create a table of popular dog breeds sorted alphabetically and have a column for hostility shutting them out into price now when I send that off it's not going to give us just plain text but it will actually generate us this awesome table of a ton of dog breeds sorted exactly how we wanted them to and when you add output formatting to your prompts it's important to understand that you don't actually have

to do this just to generate new content and a new output but you can actually paste in existing content that you have and reformat it within chat GPT that way as well chat GPT tip number three is to generate to-do lists within chat gbt now this is very powerful because if you have a paragraph of text and there's some to-do's in there but then there's also some filler information you can tell chat gbt to create a to-do list from that paragraph let me show you what I mean so in here we have this big

arbitrary text from a mom to a son telling him to do these chores but there's a bunch of filler information here and this was just set in a large text message so if you work better in to-do lists then this tip will be great for you maybe your boss sends you an email and you need to ciph through it and create a to-do list out of that email but it's super long and you just want to know what do I have to do right now well Chad gbt is great at that so before this entire paragraph full of different chores that this sun has to

complete what we're going to do is we're going to hold shift and enter down twice and now we are going to say to chat gbt generate a to-do list from this paragraph and then I'm going to put a colon and now we can send it off and from this big paragraph chegebt will create a nice to-do list so we know exactly what we have to do so now when I send it off it gives us a nice little to-do list here so step one take out the trash step two water the plants give the dog a bath clean your room go to the store and buy and then it gives us a

nice list of what we need to buy at the store jet gbt tip number four is to rename your chat logs for better organization now this tip is often overlooked and I even overlooked it myself usually I would just let Chad gbt generate all of the names of my chat but when I realized that you could actually rename these it helped me organize my dashboard a little bit better so if you go into here let's say we want to rename this chore list that we just got from last tip what we can do is we can hit this little pencil icon and then we can

delete this and give it our own name so maybe you want to organize it by number by person whatever it may be you can list it here maybe maybe I'll just name this one chore list and I will put the date and when you're done making your edit what you have to do is hit that little check mark and then it's nicely named for you chatgbt tip number five is to prompt follow-up questions now this one may seem a little bit Broad and there are multiple follow-up questions you can ask chat gbt but it's important

to understand that after your first response the thread doesn't stop there chat gbt actually can keep on talking and going within that thread and it doesn't have to be just questions either it can be commands as well you could tell chatgpt to go a little bit deeper or explain something step by step there are so many different follow-up commands based on your situation but it's important to understand that you can learn a lot more when you actually keep on prompting follow-up questions or commands now let's take a look again at

this to-do list example where we generated a to-do list from this paragraph and got all of these items what we could tell jgbt to do is to organize these tasks based on how long they're going to take and then order all of these chores from the one that takes the most time to the least time so what we've told judge BT to do in this follow-up question and command is give these chores an estimated time required and then organize them from high to low so when we send that off as you can see this makes it much more powerful so if

we want to get those hard heavy tasks out of the way first now we have them organized with an estimated amount of time chat gbt tip number six is to use explain it to a child within chat gbt now this may sound a little confusing at first but chatgpt can actually explain certain topics as if it were trying to help a child understand what that complex topic was about so if you're ever struggling to read an article or need help on a topic you can do this technique so for this example let's say we just have a general topic that we

want to explain to somebody and we don't know the best way to explain it well oftentimes the way you explain it to a child and the thought process that goes into that helps adults and grown people will understand the topic better as well so what we can do is we can type in explain topic and then we can add to a five-year-old and jet gbt does a pretty good job it starts by saying so you know how you have toys that are special and unique to you and even if you aren't necessarily explaining it to a five-year-old it helps adults understand

topics a little bit better as well chat gbt tip number seven is to change your dashboard appearance within chatgpt so if you go down to the bottom left hand corner of your screen and you hit those little three dots and then go to settings you can actually change the way chatgpt looks so if you want it on your system colors what you can do is leave it at system you can change it to dark mode which I'm on right now or you can change it to the blinding light mode chat GPT tip number eight is to share your chat thread links with friends Chad

gbt recently added this where you can now share your chat thread in a view only mode to other people through email so let's say I wanted to show this explanation of cryptocurrency to one of my friends what I could do is I could now hit this little share button right next to the rename button and it will pop up with this new window here it says share link to chat you can rename your chat right here and you also have the option to either share your name or share this anonymously then what I can do is I can hit copy link so if I were

to go to that link this is what it would look like chat GPT tip number nine is to change the tone of your writing you can either do this with existing writing or generated writing that chat gbt generates for you so let's say you have an email and you aren't in your best writing mood and you want to make this a little bit more formal well what you can do is you can change the tone of your writing to be in a more formal manner so we have this email that I'm sending to my fake boss and it says hey John hope

this email finds you well I wanted to give you a heads up that I won't be able to make it into the office today because I ain't feeling too well so I have some odd text here because I ain't feeling too well you know it's pretty informal then I say don't worry about me have a good one Drake we need to spice this up we need to make this formal in order for my boss not to fire me because I'm leaving these types of emails so what I can do is I can enter down a few times while holding shift and then I can tell

Chad GPT to make this email more formal and now I'm going to send it off and chat gbt will do a nice job at helping as you can see if you read the differences in the two you can tell just by changing the tone of your writing it makes this email a lot more sendable you can really display your emotions with tones and that's why I like using them so much so I can say change the tone of that email to show anger towards my boss and now when I send it off as you can see this email will be very angry this line especially is pretty bad it is

rather frustrating to find myself in such a predicament particularly after encountering an appalling lack of support from the management now I told Chad gbt to make this email depressing and it has an entirely new response you can pause the video and read those and they turn out very nicely it's something so small but powerful that you can add to your prompting and chat gbt chat gbt tip number 10 is to consider purchasing my chat gbt Mastery course now if you've made it this far in the video you're

definitely interested in learning more about chatgpt so let me show you a little bit about what that course has to offer in this course you get a nice back-end learning experience where you can change to dark mode maximize your screen and I have 25 plus private chat gbt modules that are not shared on YouTube within this course and I'll take a little scroll down if you want to view some of the content first we go over the basics of chat GPT some of the use cases beginners prompting then we get into advanced prompting I dive deep into the

plugins and web browsing features ethics and limitations then I go into Concepts about how I've applied chat gbt for success in my life from scaling my income to making health and workout plans customized to my specific metrics and then this last section here shows you how to install the free notion template that I also give you with access to this course now with the course you'll also obtain entry to the chat GPT Mastery Group which is a private group of actively learning chat GPT enthusiasts like yourself so if you

work better in a course you know self-study learning step by step up how to become from an absolute beginner to a pro and a master of chat gbt then that course might be for you so I'll leave a link in the top end comment in the description below so you can go to that page to get a little bit more information about that course if it's something that you're interested in chat gbt tip number 11 is to be concise within your prompting now I'm sure you hear this flying around a lot within the chat GPT space to be concise but it is

very important to be as concise as possible with what you want out of chat gbt it's also very important when you're doing more advanced prompting techniques to tell chat gbt exactly how you want it to act or how you want it to format your output if we take a look at this table I created within the output formatting tip as you can see this was a pretty concise prompt create a table of popular dog breeds sorted alphabetically and have a column for hostility shutting them out into price I got straight to the point I

didn't use many filler words and I listed exactly what I wanted within the table and chatgpt produced awesome results chat gbt tip number 12 is to change the style of your writing now style and tone sometimes go hand in hand but I like to think of style as something like celebrities characters or anything of that matter so this could be an example of a style being used within your prompting in chat gbt I have what I want jojobt to do so write a car detailing advertisement and then I have in the style of you can really change

the advertisement by adding any celebrity fictional character non-fictional character you name it and in this case we are going to be doing in the style of Darth Vader so this could be quite interesting as a car detailing advertisement I'm going to send it off and as you can see it gives pretty much everything that would be required in order for Darth Vader to actually be saying this advertisement it even gives annotations for what would be good to add in for certain camera angles and sound production so it says dark

dramatic John Williams score intensifies John Williams is the creator of the music of Star Wars and it makes this advertisement very nice do due to the changing of the style in a galaxy plagued by Dustin Grime one name stands Above the Rest Imperial Auto Detailing and then in the Darth Vader voice you underestimate the power of a clean vehicle it's very dramatic and it lists out this entire script for us in order to write this car detailing advertisement in that certain style chat gbt tip number 13 is to use chat gbt for

quick learning on a new subject you can use chat gbt in order to learn things so quick from summarizing articles to generating lists from generating key points of historical events on command for example I could say something like create a list of all important political figures in World War II and when I send it off judge BT is giving us this huge list that we can easily learn from so I find that this is an amazing way to learn because it just gives us the key points we don't have to go searching around everywhere and it's all right

here within this one dashboard and now I can just study this list in order to be educated on the political figures of World War II so let's say you want to quickly learn this article The Proven path to doing unique and meaningful work on jamesclere.com but what you can do instead of reading through all of this is you can highlight the entire article and hit Ctrl C go over to chadbt and say create a summary in the key action steps from this article I could apply today enter down and paste in that article and

now I can send that off in this entire article chat GPT will summarize and give me key action steps that I can apply today so what jgbt is it went from having all of this information to having one nice summary with seven action steps so you can learn new topics super quick using chat gbt chat gbt tip number 14 is to consider upgrading to plus if you haven't already now if you are just using chatgpt for writing basic blog posts or drafting emails and this may not be necessary but if you like diving deep into chat gbt and you need that

advanced reasoning the plugins and the web browsing features then it's definitely worth the twenty dollars per month you get Priority Access to new features when they come out jgbt is always available even when demand is high Ai and you also get chat gpt4 which is awesome with its Advanced reasoning and figuring out solutions to more complex issues you also get plugins in web browsing which is a whole other realm of chat GPT jet GPT tip number 15 is to view the plugin store now there are hundreds of third-party Integrations

with Chad gbt that make Chad gbt so much more powerful than what it already is so if I hover over chat gbt4 and I go into the plugins section I can hit this drop down and go to plugin store here I can take a look at all 77 chat gbt plug-in pages with eight plugins on each page and I can even search these plugins based on a certain keyword so if I want plugins that deal with YouTube what I can do is I can scroll through all of these plugins that help with certain YouTube Integrations their plugins help you with Advanced

graphing based on your input so it'll actually graph your information and put it within Chad gbt for you there's plugins that can make shopping carts and grocery lists for you so plugins add a whole new game to chat gbt and I wish I had more time to go over all of them chatgbt tip number 16 is to use the web browsing feature in order to analyze your links so if you hover over chatgpt4 you can now go to this browse with Bing since I work on my website let's see how I can improve my website through SEO

what I can do is I can paste in my link and then I can say give me SEO recommendations for my home page and now Chad gbt will be able to analyze this link click it read the content and give me SEO recommendations based on my website that I uploaded now with this web browsing capability you can do all sorts of stuff from web scraping to data analysis to what I'm doing right now getting SEO suggestions jgbt can read the content on your page and then tell you what to do with it so now jgbt is giving me custom SEO recommendations

based on the link that I uploaded chatgpt tip number 17 is to templatize your prompts that work well so you can use them again in the future so let's say in chat gbt I use this prompt in order to generate me a very good workout I said create me a 10 minute full body workout using five pound dumbbells let's say I went through with that workout and I really liked it well instead of coming into chat gbt every time and maybe losing that prompt structure what I could do is I could templatize this prompt instead in order to make it easy

to use so I could hit this little edit button and now I can make this prompt a template by filling in any information that has the potential to change with brackets and labels so instead of 10 minute maybe what I could do is I could put bracket time and instead of full body workout I could leave work out but what I could do is I could put workout type put a bracket and maybe after time I could even leave minute because I don't want to do anything more than 60 minutes and then after using instead of five pound dumbbells I could put

equipment and now that I have this prompt all templatized what I can do is I can copy it paste it in a Google doc or something like my chat gbt organization Hub so this is the notion template that you get access to with the course but I also offer it on the side if you don't want the course but you just want the template but what I could do is I could hit add new prompt and I could give the prompt a name so I could do workout and I can type in the prompt right here I can put it in a folder I'll put it in general for now so now anytime

I want to come use this workout prompt what I can do is I can come in here copy and paste it and head over to chatgpt chatgpt tip number 18 is to revise existing text that you already have so chat gbt is all about generating that new content but it's also important to remember that you can revise that text that you already have you don't need to always only be generating content with chat gbt but you can use chat gbt to check your grammar change your style and change your tones as I was showing you so the tip revises listing text is more

so a concept to remember when using chat gbt rather than an actual applicable tip but do apply it to your chat gbt workflow because it's very powerful you can take what you have from your brain and make it even better chatgbt tip number 19 is to do step-by-step follow-alongs within chatgpt so this is great for difficult tasks what you can do is you can tell chat gbt to guide you step by step in creating whatever you're trying to create let me show you an example what I have in chat GPT is guide me step by step and help me create a

terms of service for my website give me questions I can answer and after I answer them generate me the TOs in a proper format now obviously you would actually want to get legal help for this but I'm just showing you the complex situations that Chad gbt can help guide you with step by step so when I send it off as you can see it will do exactly as I asked and it will help guide me through creating this terms of service so now it gives me all of these questions that I need to answer in order for it to properly generate that terms

of service that I needed help with and then it says once you've provided these details we can start creating a basic draft for your terms of service agreement and this just kind of helps you with complex situations not necessarily legal stuff like this but anything that involves a lot of thinking and a lot of problem solving ask jgbt to give it to you in this format chatgbt tip number 20 is to use chat gbt for entertainment purposes now it doesn't always have to be about productivity getting stuff done as quick as possible

and solving these complex problems but you can also have a little bit of fun along the way jgbt is great at storytelling you can give it characters a plot it can be fake it can be real it can be custom to your personal life and then it can generate fun and cool stories jgbt is also great at music Discovery so you can type in a list of your favorite artists your favorite songs and say find me similar songs that I can put on this playlist based on the information I've given you it can do the same with film and book recommendations

so if you like a certain film or you like a certain book you can type that in the chat you GPT and say give me more suggestions based on this once again jgbt is limited in knowledge up to 2021 so if you do have anything past that it might not understand it too well tip number 21 is to use chat gbt for coding assistance I've personally used this multiple times when it comes to my website because I am not a developer by any means I know very little code and what I do know isn't enough to get me through so I can type in my problems to

chat GPT and it can help work through some of that code let me give you a quick example about how I go about my code which is probably a very bad way of going about it but it actually works so let's say I want to change the look of this button what I would do is I would hover over it and I would hit inspect and then I would copy the entire button class that I'm trying to change then I would hover over copy and select copy element and then I would give my command so help me change the CSS of this button

to be orange and blue and then I would just paste in that entire element I copied and a lot of the time I just paste it in in this format that isn't very good but when I send it off Chad GPT generates a nice code block for me and I would say ninety percent of the time this method works for me when it comes to generating CSS as you can see it goes in depth it gives me nice code blocks where I can copy this code I can also upload existing code and ask Chad gbt what am I doing wrong here and it will give me a nice response on how to

fix that and a lot of the time it actually gives you the code in that fixed format chatgbt tip number 22 is to brainstorm new ideas now brainstorming and chatgbt is one of its most powerful methods of learning and generating knowledge in my opinion it's what I actually use it for most I like how it gives me all of these ideas that I can pick and choose from a list of ones that I like so I can type into chat GPT something like help me brainstorm business name ideas and when I send it off what it will do is it'll kind of

guide me through this process on how it can help me with brainstorming so it says to provide the most relevant suggestions could you please provide me with more information the industry product Services target audience and any specific words or themes I would like to incorporate so then it kind of gets your mind spinning it's like okay so now I have a list of things that I can give Chad gbt and it will generate results based on that so I've given Chad gbt extra information artificial intelligence is the industry

and courses are the products I want this name simple and luxurious and then I can say something like give me 20 suggestions and I can send it off and this is just a great way to brainstorm it kind of helps pick your brain on what you actually want and it gives you suggestions that you don't necessarily have to pick but it's a good foundation and it's a good start to build off of jet gbt tip number 23 is to use chat gbt as a tool for mediation so if you have a central problem that two people are disagreeing on and you have both sides

of the stories and you want to settle this through the flip of a coin well what you could do is actually instead of flipping a coin use Chad gbt to decide which is the most logical way of going about this problem or who has the most rational idea when it comes to the issue now of course when it comes to much bigger problems this is a bad way of going about it because Chad gbt can't feel physical emotion but emotion is completely out of play here it's going strictly off logic so what I've done is

I've typed out this fake problem of two people disagreeing over who should get the last gummy bear within the bag of Gummy Bears so my friend Jane and I are discussing this and we are arguing over on who should get the last one so what I tell you LGBT is the problem is who should get the last gummy bear in the bag Jane's argument and then I list out Jane's argument I should get the last gummy bear because I bought the packet and shared it with you it's only fair that the purchaser gets the last piece

right my argument but Jane I should get the last gummy bear because I dreamed about a giant gummy bear chasing me last night it's a sign I need to eat this one to ward off any future gummy bear nightmares and then we can ask shajibiti the mediator in the situation who should get the last gummy bear and chat gbt gives a bunch of information on the outcomes of the argument and it says based on these considerations Jane's argument seems more grounded and widely accepted and principles of fairness and respect so in that case Jane would win

that argument chat GPT tip number 24 is to use Chad gbt in order to journal just like me showing you that example going through the step-by-step guides Changi BT can ask you questions in order to write an effective journal on your day so what I've done is I've asked chatgpt to ask me questions that I can answer for my Daily Journal and after I answer them format my journal from my text so now when I send it off jgbt will give me a list of questions in order to help me write a good journal and then it will

format it all for me so now I've answered these questions with some arbitrary information and when I send it off jgbt will finish the job of creating this nice journal entry for me and it does a pretty good job by asking you those important questions that go well within a journal and it even gave me a nice journal entry date which is today July 3rd 2023 jet gbt tip number 25 is to export your chat logs to your email within chatgpt this can be a good way to secure and save your information especially if you're learning something

new and you don't want to lose that chat thread then exporting your chat logs could be a good way to go about saving that you can export your chat logs by going to the bottom left hand corner of your screen and hitting those three dots then going to settings next go to data controls and where it says export data on the third row right there you want to hit export and then it gives all the information that will be exported and this information will be sent to your email so you're requesting a data export

and I can hit confirm export and now it's saying I should receive an email shortly with all of my data so I'm going to hit this download export right here and this comes in the form of a zip file where I can open it and then I can view all of my chat logs and conversations in different model comparisons chatgpt tip number 26 is to understand the limitations of chat gbt now it's a bit more on the bore inside of chat gbt but it's very important to understand these limitations so you don't get blindsided

when you're trying to type in your prompt and something doesn't work or you don't know why the answers are answering in a specific way so some of the most important limitations are its knowledge availability that's why the web browsing feature is so awesome but it's limited up to knowledge to September of 2021 so that is a limitation of chat GPT also it does have a bit of a bias because it's been trained on human knowledge from the internet so if there is a bias on the internet then it will also acquire some

of that bias now another limitation is it does sometimes generate non-factual or plagiarized information so it's always important to check that jet gbt tip number 27 is to use human-like text within your inputs you don't need to try to sound formal or try to make yourself sound like a professor when you're talking to chat GPT it's important that you talk to it as a human would talk to it because that's the kind of knowledge it's been trained on is human-like conversation now there's a fine line to

draw between talking too much like a human and not being concise and providing proper context within your problems as well so you have to be careful with that Chad gbt tip number 28 is to check your responses for plagiarism before copying pasting your and sensors so if you get a new story a new creative writing blog post advertisement whatever it may be before you upload it to anything important always check for plagiarism now I haven't had any experience with plagiarism but I have heard of others experiencing some so before you upload

your text to anything important make sure that you check it for plagiarism so you're not accidentally taking somebody else's work Chad gbt tip number 29 is to use chat gbt for studying so this is great if you want to like I showed you earlier learn something very quickly by summarizing it but you can also use it for more of a studying concept like flash cards so if we take our list of important World War II political figures from earlier and we paste it into chat gbt I can say here's a list of some

important political figures during World War II and then I can list out all of those political figures and what they were doing at the time and next I can tell Chad gbt to generate me flash cards and give me a quiz so I told jgbt to generate me flash cards on these political leaders and quiz me by saying the description and I have to answer with the name correctly if I'm correct say correct and move on if I'm incorrect say incorrect then give me the right answer and then move on so we have some complex descriptions here for chat gbt

that is why I am in tragedy bt4 but I'm going to send this off and now Chad GPT is going to generate some interactive flash cards but what I can do is answer and if I get it correct let's see if it does its job so I'm going to paste in that answer there and this should be correct let's see what Chad gbt does correct let's move on to the next one and then it goes on to the next question that I have to answer so this is great for studying or you can even do this with job interviews for a specific

position as well Chad gbt tip number 30 is to use your generated knowledge in order to create more creative writing so this is kind of a cool little approach and it's more of an advanced prompting technique but what you're actually doing is you're creating knowledge within chat gbt you're taking that knowledge that you created within chat gbt and generating more creative writing in chat gbt so first what I can do is I can generate some knowledge so for this example I'm going to say give me 10
