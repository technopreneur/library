[Music]

i want to share with you a different way

of looking at language learning

and an adventure that it took me on

[Music]

i feel very strongly that the way

languages are taught traditionally in

school

is immensely frustrating and it's very

inefficient

it is my belief that language learning

can be exciting

and truly mind-expanding that is the

inspiration behind all of my language

adventures

so i'm going to draw out how i visualize

this and explain as i go along

to conceptualize how i see language

learning how i see this whole process

this is a significant investment in

terms of time and energy

it is not easy to learn a language and i

think the more concrete we can turn

something that is

abstract and potentially overwhelming

the easier it becomes to break it down

to understand what's going on to make

progress

and by far the most important of all to

enjoy the process

first and foremost i think what is

lacking is

a clear explanation as to the mechanics

of language

in general how language works these are

universal

concepts that apply to all languages no

matter what you're learning or what you

speak

this is a reflection of human nature

really how we use language

it changed everything for me and how i

saw languages when i finally

saw things clearly through this lens

take it or leave it it's up to you

the way i have always traditionally

visualized

language is like a solar system where we

have concentric circles

building out now this is not new but

there's a concept essentially that we

need to

take into account here which is word

frequency some words

are used a lot more than others words

and phrases

so for example a word like the or

a or and those are very very common

words in english

and they're used a lot more often than a

random word like

dolphins or horses for that matter not

that those

nouns are not important but they're used

less often than

the can you imagine trying to have an

entire conversation without using the

word the

it'd be difficult what we're trying to

do here is rank by importance

and everything gets ranked so with this

concept of language okay

this solar system we're going to build

this out in terms of

word frequency where the most frequently

used words are at the very center

okay ranked by frequency of usage and as

you build out

it's less and less commonly used words

so this circle here

represents the top 10 percent of words

used in the english language or any

given language all the way out

to the final circle now a couple things

to keep in mind here

first of all these exact words will look

differently

depending on the language and how it's

structured and how it's used

so the top 10 of words

in english are not going to be

necessarily exactly the same as in

spanish for example and there's a level

of personalization

that's going on here in that that top

ten percent of words

that is used by any given person is

going to be a reflection of how they

think

and their vocabulary and their life and

their interests

so your top ten percent isn't

necessarily exactly like

my top 10 in english i always felt

during my exchange year in france where

i did become

fluent in the language that my

vocabulary in

cuisine in food in general was weak it

wasn't as good as it could be

it was because that year i didn't spend

a lot of time cooking so my cuisine

and food vocabulary is probably

ranked lower than somebody else learning

the french language

uh to become a chef i would imagine

their cuisine

and food vocabulary is much higher much

more important probably in the top 10 or

20 percent

now here's the thing i just built this

out this solar system

that represents a language in terms of

evenly spread out circles but that's not

actually how this works

what we need to do here is a weighted

representation of word frequency of how

often words are actually used in terms

of how much space they take up

in the solar system what this should

actually probably look like

is the inner circle is

much much larger okay takes up a huge

percentage of the total solar system

because

that top 10 percent of words actually

accounts for

well over half of all language use

in the language and then the next circle

takes up

a another large percentage of the solar

system but much smaller than the first

circle

and then smaller and smaller and smaller

this is actually how

language works this is known as the

pareto principle also commonly known as

the 80 20 rule

i've talked about this before this

applies to so many

different domains in life if you're

curious about this idea i highly

recommend you look further into it

because i've actually used this

law of the universe of nature in

how i organize my life in where my time

and energy goes

how i can sort of maximize what i'm

doing

i feel like you got to give yourself

every possible advantage that you can

so let's talk about takeaways from all

of this i think it's

very powerful to approach language

learning in terms of prioritization

what is the top one percent of most

frequently used words and expressions

what is going to take me the furthest in

terms of comprehension in terms of

self-expression

especially in the beginning to get the

boat offshore this can of course

expand out to eventually fill most if

not all of the solar system right

that's the goal but it doesn't all have

to happen at once in fact i think that's

why

it can feel so overwhelming to get going

with the language

it's actually incredible how much

coverage you can have on a language

with a very small set of very commonly

used words and expressions there's a lot

of research about this out there

that i will link to down below so that's

it you have

my secret you can now go out and apply

it to whatever language that you're

learning

really have nothing to hide here i take

such great joy

in seeing other people share my passion

for languages so please

like use this however you see fit if you

feel lost about how to go about this

i worked for four months with my friend

johnny harris to create a language

learning course

to answer all questions that you may

have we went

way way more in depth into this way of

approaching language and between the two

of us we shared all the tools and

techniques that we have

to learn to memorize to

go through this entire process to

navigate the choppy waters of learning a

new language

i'm honestly really proud of how it came

out it contains everything i know

about language learning up to this point

the reason i charge money for it

is just because of the amount of effort

and energy and research

and time that went into making this

happen so i'll link to it down below

if you're interested i made a lot of

language learning materials available

for free on my website and all you have

to do is sign up to my newsletter which

is also free and i'll send it to you the

thing that i always go back to is that

language is experiential it is something

that is meant to be used

i only learn languages to connect with

other people

and to understand their way of seeing

the world and

living life it is really not about lists

of words or tables of conjugation so in

the spirit of capturing what excites me

about

languages i wanted to share a little

adventure that i went on a few months

ago with a belgian friend of mine this

is for the love

of travel and exploration and it would

have never been possible had i never

learned

french on a road

somewhere in southern portugal the light

is just ridiculous right now i mean

ridiculous

and with my belgian friend

greg gregoire gregory just i don't know

greg that cooks

basically uh i'm gonna attempt to learn

how to drive

uh stick for the first time ever so

we'll see we'll see how that goes i

don't think it's super complicated but

i'm uh we'll see how things go before i

dive in though i do want to talk briefly

about the sponsor of this video

morning brew my new big thing is

newsletters

i think that's probably the reason why i

mention mine so often

it's because i think i'm coming to

realize that it is an amazing way to

reach people and to share ideas and that

i think is why it's growing so quickly

morning brew is like the tech finance

version of what i'm doing

i found that it's a way less intrusive

less distracting way

of getting distilled down information on

what's going on in the world

this is one of my many solutions to

spend less time on social media i feel

like i'm learning from it

it's well written interesting and free

and it helped me

follow along with the whole gamestop

saga for example

the newsletter goes out daily monday

through saturday so if you're interested

in tech

business or finance consider checking it

out it takes like 15 seconds to sign up

and i'll link to it down below i read it

so thank you morning brew for sponsoring

this video

now on to my adventure

all in all i'm gonna need a lot more

practice to feel comfortable driving

stick

but this is a really great start
