This linguistic journey will delve into the art of becoming more articulate with your words. If you wish to learn how to speak powerfully and precisly, learn to wield the enchantment of alliteration, paint vivid pictures with metaphors, and infuse your speech with the timeless charm of classical vocabulary. Whether you're a wordsmith-in-training or a seasoned speaker, this video will equip you with the tools to turn your words into a articulate performance. :) [0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIBSb3bNAQM&t=0s) Intro [1:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIBSb3bNAQM&t=60s) Using Alliteration [4:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIBSb3bNAQM&t=269s) Using Metaphor [8:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIBSb3bNAQM&t=539s) Using Classical Flavoring


we're gonna take one of my real

conversations and learn how we can make

the language more athletic and artistic

using three techniques that every

articulate speaker understands here's a

brief sample of the conversation did you

finish the book you were reading I did

on the flight home I had an interesting

thought that I was pursuing inspired by

the book

is probably how I would describe it you

consider time not spelling technology

waste I don't know I suppose

my mind at least is convinced of that

it's almost as if the amount of time

that's a standard natural exchange of

ideas nothing particularly wrong with

the choice of words used

however we're not here to speak

ordinarily what can we do to give my

words flavor and freshness many of the

greatest articulators will be studying

throughout this video understand that

language is something that you can make

your own you don't have to choose the

obvious word paths that everyone pursues

the first way that we can achieve this

kind of verbal athleticism is by using

alliteration alliteration is the fun

repetition of any consonant sound in two

or more closely associated words listen

to the following examples we groom and

we graze together he's an incredibly

popular and populist figure confident in

the sanity and sobriety authoritarian

forces are abundant and abound is

determined and cannot be deterred

wishing to whistle their way up the

aisle that Fierce adolescent fire

alliteration is one of the main

mechanics of sound responsible for

generating rhythm in a sentence I've

metically studied the speakers from the

clips we just reviewed and have

identified a process for producing

alliteration alliteration is not a

decision that you make in advance I'm

going to employ alliteration in this

sentence no

alliteration is something you weave into

the fabric of your sentences because it

feels natural the first step many

articulate speakers take is committing

to memory alliterative phrases known as

word couplings this is remarkable if you

can learn to understand this the first

word in these word couplings acts as a

trigger for introducing the rest of the

phrase all you have to do is encounter

the trigger word in your speaking and

the alliterative phrase is summoned and

effortlessly falls into your sentences

in fact here are two examples of this

process happening to me I was a trip to

Washington Washington was wonderful

wonderful and wonder filled and here I

am desperately attempting to find a

solution I begin scampering and Scouting

For possible angles that might provide

relief below this video I'll link the

list of alliterative phrases that I've

assembled for myself

beyond having a stalk of phrases you can

learn to generate alliteration in real

time in fact it starts with defining

what I call the anchor the anchor is the

word that has potential alliterative

properties that you want to influence

your other words for example let's take

the following sentence the weather was

good the weather was rainy to be

expected

yet

amazing now of course it senses could

function fine by itself

or what I could do is single out that

first adjective rainy use that as the

anchor and let that first letter r

continue to ring through my mind as I

search for a second adjective that

begins with the letter R and hopefully

has a similar meaning to what I wanted

to convey that being the idea that the

weather was amazing

an adjective that meets those criteria

could be refreshing the weather was

rainy to be expected yet refreshing

ideally you'd want the words to be

closer together but even still as

distant as they are

it introduces a subtle poetic flavor to

your sentence the more you make a

deliberate effort to seed your sentences

with alliteration the easier it becomes

to effortlessly yoke words together

alliteration for me has become a fun way

of Galloping through a sentence letting

the letters season the sentence often I

don't even think about it anymore

finally I would add alliteration is not

an excuse to be redundant with your

words you wouldn't photograph an animal

twice from the same angle ideally you

capture multiple angles that each

complement a different feature of the

animal in the same way alliteration

serves to capture different angles of an

idea and often break a vague word into

two or more distinct Parts using that

poetic touch the next modification we're

gonna make is to use metaphor metaphor

is a figure of speech that describes an

object or action as if it were something

else typically bestowing upon something

ordinary the qualities of some something

possessing heavy imagery for example

mental landscape intellectual joust

ideological cocktail theater of your

imagination Mosaic of information Army

of snow stormy attitude it mushroomed

into a viral Trend I can't digest what

you're telling me other examples from

popular films and public figures include

bodies a loaded gun I'll have to agree

with The Walking thesaurus on that one

I'm a dog chasing cars we're reminded

all the time everything casts a shadow

yeah experiment until you find the vein

of Effectiveness that took us down some

incredible Avenues jump starts our

fear engine in each example what's

happening is an ordinary idea is being

compared with something else

and cast with a visual quality here's

how I like to think about metaphors this

should help explain this you have an

idea you're attempting to sear into the

mind of your listener it might be the

spontaneous burst of thought erupting in

your mind for the first time in a

conversation

perhaps it's something you've thought of

before you have a choice between

Scavenging for the right words

and often having to settle on a set of

dull and dreary sentences that fall

short of conveying your idea or you can

invoke a metaphor and furnish your idea

with depth and most importantly

familiarity that excites your listener

this shows verbal athleticism your

ability to build off of the Common

Ground between you unlike alliteration

you don't want to memorize a stock list

of phrases and then shoehorn them into

your sentences the objective with

metaphor is to be agile and creative

athletic as we say with your language

every one of us can construct a metaphor

we simply need to know how to direct our

Focus properly there's an example of me

using a metaphor in the conversation for

this video actually I had a headache the

entire weekend there was an absolute War

reaching in my head I don't know if it

was the process I learned for producing

metaphor involves asking yourself two

questions

question one what characteristics does

my idea have the idea from the

conversation we watched was a simple one

headache what characteristics does

headache have

well top of Mind headache

has pain

pulsing pounds

you might even throw in torture

we choose one in the moment I believe I

was thinking pain now we ask the second

question what else has that

characteristic this is important to

understand this is so cool

words are like musical notes they have

close relationships with other words and

they can in a sense belong to the same

key for example

let's try to think in the key of pain

what other words preferably nouns are in

the same frame as the word pain

those might be words such as wound

suffering War

Battlefield stab heartbreak all these

words are related to each other by

virtue of their relationship to the key

or frame of pain in the conversation

that we're analyzing in this video I

remember stepping through this and

thinking pain this happens very quickly

and you get good at asking these

questions in less than a second

certainly there were better options than

pain that existed and from Pain the

characteristic I identified was War

which was the metaphor that I created

like alliteration the best metaphors

aren't planned in advance they come on

what I would describe as a flare of

inspiration we stumble into metaphors

through accidental words that

unconsciously provide the tripwire I

want to think of it now more as as a

receiver inside of you right almost like

tuning a radio he does not want to

offend anyone uh he doesn't Gore

anyone's sacred cow except on these

narrow topics for instance I'll observe

people who shamelessly litter or throw

paper towels on the floor at the gym and

wonder how many of these micro acts of

desecration does it take how many times

do you have to be the Vandal in the art

gallery until you've eroded every sense

of responsibility the final modification

we're gonna make to our language is to

season our sentences with some classical

flavoring some time ago I made a list of

the particular words and expressions

that I noticed were common denominators

in nearly every articulate speaker in

the last 50 years absorbing these words

into your vocabulary can very magical

lean instantly give your communication

an aesthetic of class and curiosity here

are several examples of these words and

expressions perhaps as an alternative to

maybe maybe we should consider turning

perhaps we should consider turning I

suppose as a substitute for I feel like

I feel like we just need more time I

suppose I just need more time

vast as in a vast field of grass with a

vast red population in public Shear as

in the sheer bravery it took of course

as in now of course this doesn't mean

great many as in there were great many

challenges instead of tons or a bunch

naturally as in naturally I was inclined

to say hello

terribly as in we were terribly anxious

about the performance tremendously as in

the process was tremendously exciting he

had tremendous courage can we not

instead of why can't we can we not find

a solution perhaps you're familiar with

most of these in fact

in some circumstances I've employed one

or two of these words and expressions

and have been immediately called

articulate I'm not I'm still very much

at work in progress in fact in the

process of strengthening my own

athleticism with language I've been over

these last few months writing software

designed to help me collapse my thoughts

into orderly precise articulate

sentences if you're interested in
