I will suggest a protocol by which you

can achieve a better relationship to

your activities and to your dopamine

system in fact it will help tune up your

dopamine system for discipline

hard work and motivation hard work is

hard generally most people don't like

working hard

some people do but most people work hard

in order to achieve some end goal end

goals are terrific and rewards are

terrific whether or not they are

monetary social

or any kind however because of the way

that dopamine relates to our perception

of time working hard at something for

sake of a reward that comes afterward

can make the hard work much more

challenging and make us much less likely

to lean into hard work in the future let

me give you a couple examples by way of

data and experiments there's a classic

experiment done actually at Stanford

many years ago in which children in

Nursery School and kindergarten Drew

pictures and they drew pictures because

they like to draw

the researchers took kids that liked to

draw

and they started giving them a reward

for drawing the reward generally was a

gold star or something that a young

child would find rewarding then they

stopped giving them the gold star

and what they found is the children had

a much lower tendency

to draw on their own

no reward now remember this was an

activity that prior to receiving a

reward the children intrinsically

enjoyed and selected to do

no one was telling them to draw what

this relates to is so-called intrinsic

versus extrinsic reinforcement when we

receive rewards even if we give

ourselves rewards for something

we tend to associate less pleasure with

the actual activity itself that evoked

the reward now that might seem

counter-intuitive but that's just way

the way that these dopaminergic circuits

work

and now understanding these Peaks and

baselines in dopamine which I won't

review again

this should make sense if you get a peak

in dopamine from a reward it's going to

lower your Baseline and the cognitive

interpretation

is that you didn't really do the

activity because you enjoyed the

activity you did it for the reward now

this doesn't mean all rewards of all

kinds are bad but it's also important to

understand that dopamine controls our

perception of time when and how much

dopamine we experience is the way that

we carve up what we call our experience

of time when we engage in an activity

let's say school or hard work of any

kind or exercise

because of the reward we are going to

give ourselves a receive at the end the

trophy the Sunday the meal whatever it

happens to be

we actually are extending the time bin

over which we are

analyzing or perceiving that experience

and because the reward comes at the end

we start to dissociate the neural

circuits for dopamine and reward that

would have normally been active during

the activity

and because it all arrives at the end

over time we have the experience of less

and less pleasure from that particular

activity while we're doing it now this

is the antithesis of growth mindset my

colleague at Stanford Carol dweck as

many of you know has come up with this

incredible Theory and principle and it

actually goes beyond theory in principle

called growth mindset which is this

striving to be better to be in this

mindset of I'm not there yet but

striving itself is

the end goal and that of course delivers

you to tremendous performance has been

observed over and over and over again

that people that have growth mindset

kids that have growth mindset end up

performing very well because they're

focused on the effort itself and all of

us can cultivate growth mindset the

neural mechanism of cultivating growth

mindset involves learning to access the

rewards from effort and doing and that's

hard to do

because you have to engage this

prefrontal component of the mesolymbic

circuit you have to tell yourself okay

this effort is great this effort is

pleasureful even though you might

actually be in a state of physical pain

from the exercise or I can recall this

from college just feeling like I want to

get up from my desk but forcing myself

to study forcing myself and forcing

myself what you find over time is that

you can start to associate a dopamine

release you can evoke dopamine release

from the friction and the challenge that

you happen to be in

you completely eliminate the ability to

generate those circuits and the

rewarding process of being able to

reward friction while in effort if you

are focused only on the goal that comes

at the end because of the way that

dopamine marks time so if you say oh I'm

going to do this very hard thing and I'm

going to push and push and push and push

for that end goal that comes later

not only do you enjoy the process of

what you're doing less you actually make

it more painful while you're engaging in

it you make yourself less efficient at

it because if you were able to access

dopamine while in effort dopamine has

all these incredible properties of

increasing the amount of energy in our

body and in our mind our ability to

focus by way of dopamine's conversion

into epinephrine but also you are

undermining your ability to lean back

into that activity the next time the

next time you need

twice as much coffee and three times as

much loud music and four times as much

energy drink and the social connection

just to get out the door in order to do

the run or to study so

what's more beneficial in fact can serve

as a tremendous amplifier on all

Endeavors that you engage in

especially hard Endeavors is to a not

start layering in other sources of

dopamine in order to get to the starting

line not layering in other sources of

dopamine in order to be able to continue

but rather

to subjectively start to attach the

feeling of friction and effort

to an internally generated reward system

and this is not meant to be vague this

is a system that exists in your mind

that exists in the minds of humans for

hundreds of thousands of years by which

you're not just pursuing the things that

are innately pleasureful food sex warmth

water when you're thirsty but the beauty

of this misolimbic reward pathway that I

talked about earlier is that it includes

the forebrain so you can tell yourself

the effort part is the good part I know

it's painful I know this doesn't feel

good but I'm focused on this I'm going

to start to access the reward you will

find the rewards meaning the dopamine

release inside of effort if you repeat

this over and over again and what's

beautiful about it is that it starts to

become reflexive for all types of effort

when we focus only on the trophy only on

the grade only on the win as the reward

you undermine that entire process

so how do you do this

you do this in those moments of the most

intense friction you tell yourself this

is very painful and because it's painful

it will evoke an increase in dopamine

release later meaning it will increase

my Baseline in dopamine

but you also have to tell yourself that

in that moment

you are doing it by choice and you're

doing it because

you love it and I know that sounds like

lying to yourself and in some ways it is

lying to yourself but it's lying to

yourself in the context of a truth which

is

that you want it to feel better you want

it to feel even pleasureful now this is

very far and away different from

thinking about the reward that comes at

the end the hot fudge sundae for after

you cross the finish line and you can

replace hot fudge Sunday with whatever

reward happens to to be appealing to you

we Revere people who are capable of

doing what I'm describing

David Goggins comes to mind is a really

good example many of you are probably

familiar with David Goggins former Navy

SEAL who essentially has made a

post-military career career out of

explaining and sharing his process of

turning the effort into the reward

there are many other examples of this

too of course

throughout evolutionary history there's

no question that we revered people who

were willing to go out and forage and

hunt and gather and caretake

in ways that other members of our

species probably found exhausting and

probably would have preferred to just

put their feet up or soak them in a cool

stream rather than continue to forage

the ability to access this pleasure from

effort

aspect of our dopaminergic circuitry is

without question the most powerful

aspect of dopamine in our biology of

dopamine and the beautiful thing is it's

accessible to all of us

but just to highlight the things that

can interfere with and prevent you from

getting dopamine release

from effort itself don't Spike dopamine

prior to engaging in effort

and don't Spike dopamine after engaging

in effort learn to spike your dopamine

from effort itself
