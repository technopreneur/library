**How to Write Your Investment Thesis for Your Fund - YouTube**

- **Introduction**:
  - Topic: Crafting an investment thesis for funds.
  - The episode will delve deep into the nuances of building an investment thesis.

- **Importance of Investment Thesis**:
  - An investment thesis clarifies why one should invest money through your fund.
  - It's the rationale behind beating the market or ensuring safer investments.

- **Example - Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)**:
  - A notable fund from the '90s.
  - They capitalized on the pricing difference between the 30-year bond and the 29.75-year bond.
  - However, their thesis wasn't bulletproof; they faced challenges after Russia defaulted on their bonds.

- **Crafting an Investment Thesis**:
  - **1.** Lean on your team's expertise:
    - For example, someone experienced in gym management might consider investing in gyms.
  - **2.** Partner with experts:
    - Instead of spending years learning about a new area (e.g., AI), partner with someone who has expertise in that domain.
  - **3.** Engage with PE (Private Equity) funds:
    - Ask PE funds about their ideal acquisitions, providing guidance for your investments.
  - **4.** Utilize ghost trading (for traders):
    - Simulate trading before actual investments to test the thesis.
  - **5.** Ensure the investment thesis is solid before raising money.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - A robust investment thesis will attract investors.
  - Start with understanding and fine-tuning your investment strategy, then proceed with raising money and setting up legalities.
  - It's crucial to thoroughly test the thesis, expecting potential investors to poke holes in it.
  - Funds are highly scalable, and a solid deal or thesis will naturally attract money.
  - The banking system can make more money from deposits due to multipliers, indicating ample money available for investing.

- **Conclusion**:
  - Crafting a strong investment thesis is foundational for any fund. It's vital to refine, test, and be confident in your investment strategy before seeking investors.

hey guys welcome back to the show today we're gonna talk about investment thesis how to build one how to formulate one what it is why it's good for a fund so the today should be a fun episode i think we're gonna get into the weeds and kind of connect a lot of the pieces that i think you're missing when going on the initial first stage of of even thinking about what your fund is or what you want to do yesterday i was actually on a coaching call with one of our mastermind students and we were sat down and started to talk

he said bridger because i get i get all the other stuff i get how to do capitals and our mastermind program is very extensive we go very deep on fund management how to raise money he goes i understand all that because i'm having a problem figuring out what to invest in like the first step do you guys remember the fun launch formula we'll we'll snap over to the the whiteboard of truth and justice here a lot of truth a lot of justice happens on this whiteboard so let's snap in to the whiteboard so

remember the fun launch formula you have four steps number one is is find an amazing deal to frame that out three pitch investors i'll just put a little money sign and four legal docs and you do that in that order okay if you pitch investors and no one likes it well guess what you go back to the beginning and you find another deal you find a different investment thesis and then when you raise money here you get soft commitments for investors then and only then you go and raise your legal docs right you guys have heard this before

you know it so his question was bridger i get all that but how do i find the deal and and what types of deals should i look for how can i navigate this marketplace and figure out my investment thesis now in this video i'm not going to tell you exactly what to invest in because i i really can't right it's you got to decide but i want to give you some options and enough formula for breaking out that first section of finding good deals does that sound fair all right let's hop into it so what is an investment thesis first

off an investment thesis is your argument for why you should be taking someone's money and investing it for them it's your argument of why you can beat the market or why your investment's safer than the market or why essentially someone should put money with you and where you believe you can find alpha inside of your fund now i've given you lots of fund examples and stories one fund i think is amazing this fund from the 90s called long-term capital management okay and i'll put lt ltm long-term capital management

sneak a c in there right there long-term capital management k what their entire investment thesis was was this multi-billion dollar fund one of the biggest funds in the 90s this is all they did they said hey in the u.s there is the 30-year bond and a lot of people know the 30-year bond they like to buy it and they will buy this bond now there are very few people know about this it's the 29.

75 year bond almost the same exact bond but not a lot of people know about this and in stock markets because it's a public market the stock price isn't determined by the value of the company you've seen that this year right we have companies with these crazy evaluations right i think i actually read a recent market study said right now in 2019 2020 there has been the least correlation between stock price and actual revenue of the company than ever before it's like a four percent correlation so if you think

oh revenue goes up stock price should go up right uh not so apparently this is about a four to five percent correlation between the two right now the stock price is not determined by the value of the company or value of the bond it's determined by how many buyers and sellers there are so because the 30-year bond was a more popular bond people would come and over-buy this bond it would put the stock price up a little bit more be above the 29.

75 year bond so what long-term capital management all they did their investment thesis their main investment thesis was we are going to short the 30-year bond and we are gonna buy the 29.7 year bond because there is a pricing difference between the two when they should be just about the same one is overbought and one is underbought a multi-billion dollar fund was built off of that small investment thesis just focusing on two different bonds and a pricing difference between them so your investment thesis doesn't need to be

some crazy man we're gonna buy this and take it to russia and sell it and we're gonna it doesn't need to be crazy right they a lot of investing thesis actually are very simple but effective now to finish the story on long-term capital management what happened was russia defaulted on their bonds and this this is after almost a decade of long-term capital management very famous successful fund russia defaults on their bonds so all these russian investors flee the russian market and they flood into the 30-year bond and buy it up like

crazy and because they had a short on the 30-year bond eventually they got squeezed out and they had to cover their shorts and we're we'll go into shorts in a different episode what that means but they cover their short they had to buy back the bond at a higher rate and they lost a lot of money and eventually they had to close their fund after a decade really good run they had a long-term capital management so a funds funds are you know that's and their investment thesis apparently was not sound and was not bulletproof against a

russian default on their bond they didn't put that into their investment thesis now are those guys all losers and gone now no they made actually a lot of money in those 10 years yeah failed at the end and and i don't i don't know how much investors lost or or if investors even lost money but i knew they shut down their fund but a lot of money was still made in those 10 years just fyi what i'm saying don't go don't go set up a crappy investment thesis and try to screw everybody over but just so you know even if it

it kind of fails after 10 years those 10 years are still good and still made you money and those guys are probably sitting pretty pretty nice right now all right enough of that don't be fraudulent set up good fun set up good investment thesis but that was one example all right so bridger how do i actually set up my investment thesis what does that look like so when you're developing an investment thesis the first thing i would say is lean into your team's experience so the coaching call yesterday the guy was

talking to he had a lot of experience in running and owning his own gym and that was his experience and he was asking me bridger can we you know could i do a fund in uh ai or can i do a fund in other stuff and i said yeah you can but i would say lean into your current experiences you already have if you already know gyms really well what's wrong with buying up 30 gyms and taking them and having almost a value-add fund take those that group of gyms and take it to a larger company maybe anytime fitness saying hey you can

buy these gyms for this whole portfolio of companies or taking it to a private equity fund a bigger fund a venture capital fund and our hedge fund whoever likes to buy these types of things and say hey i've got 30 gyms how would you like to buy all 30 of these gyms as a portfolio they're all running well it's all under one roof i have a friend all he does is buys up funeral homes groups them together into a package and sells them to private equity firms who like to buy packaged funeral homes and he'll go what

he does is he buys those funeral homes for about eight million dollars total he'll probably buy like four or five of them and he found that he can sell them on the public markets if they're grouped together for almost double so he'll sell that for about 15 million dollars and him and his investors split the seven million dollar difference and if you're doing 80 20 that means he took home 1.

4 million dollars on that transaction not a bad investment thesis right all he did was he found big pe funds and he went and talked to them and said hey what exact what types of deals are you exactly looking for what would be the perfect deal for you and they said well we would love to buy up these small small types of businesses and funeral homes would be awesome and we have this whole sector and this investment thesis of ours where we want to manage hundreds of funeral homes we want to group them together into a bigger

portfolio and he goes great well if i brought you x y and z funeral home would you like to buy those and they say yes we'd love that so then he goes out and starts looking for those deals finds the deal and then brings it to them and they they give him an offer so the gentleman i talked to yesterday said well why don't you ghost out your deal essentially what you can do and back to the fun launch formula of finding that deal framing it out that frame part is go to a pe fund ask them what types of things they would like to buy

what types of businesses what type of portfolio companies would they like to purchase now a lot of pe funds are going to be too big they want to buy like jcpenney or hertz right these distressed assets it's not going to be for you you got to find the right type of pe fund that's looking for maybe small business acquisitions or other types of portfolio companies that you can go out and scout and find for them and i said there's probably a fund out there that loves to buy gyms so if you went and found a pe fund

and said hey you like to buy gyms they say yeah what what is the perfect gym for you what does it look like how many clients does it have what is all what's all going on inside of the gym so what we like x y and z and you go out and look for gyms then maybe they have x and y and you can come in and value add to that gym that grew or the group of gyms you buy up let's call it nine gyms and take it to that pe fund and sell it to them now before you go buy the gyms i would ghost put these say hey i let's

say i theorize i have nine gyms i have already everything's lined up the pe fund is lined up say hey if i brought you these nine gems and they're in certain condition would you buy them and what would that multiple look like you say well we would buy them for x amount dollars you say great you go then syndicate money together or raise money in a fund go and buy those nine gyms and take it to the pe fund itself and if there's things you need to fix up on them great it's a value-add fund you can

fix some of those gyms up get more people in there get more clients because you know gym so well you've already run a gym you know how it works you know how to find clients you know how to land and build that type of business and investors are much more keen to give you money when you've previously had operational experience now but bridger wait what if i don't have any operational experience what do i do then number two is you can partner with someone who who has it he was asking bridger i really want to

do stuff in artificial intelligence should i spend the next 20 years learning about artificial intelligence and i said well you could but what if in 20 years ai just isn't that cool anymore something else came out and that's that's the new thing you spent 20 years trying to research something that didn't benefit you anything he goes oh that's a good point so what you can do is find people who have already studied it for the last decade and already are up to speed on everything that's happening in ai if you

go back to our three circles right you have your expert investor your fund manager and your money raiser circle every fund needs those three pieces so usually i do not tell people to go out and start trying to learn ai for the next 20 years so you can start a fund to build it it is way faster and more efficient to just find someone and partner with these engineers who are amazing at ai but just have no clue how to set up a fund how to file the sec how to even raise money and you can solve those problems for them and to

a potential investor you say hey this guy's got a phd from x university he's done very well this is why we believe our investment thesis works is because he has such good smarts over there i have great operational experience i've ran a gym before in other businesses and this is what we're bringing to you inside of our investment thesis is we're going to buy up ai business we're going to invest in them and go out and grow them and sell them so in general again i'm not going to tell you what to invest in right

but i want to give you the landscape of what's going on and what i do is i go out and date i date a lot of these investment ideas and thesis there's lots of different ways to make money and i've gone through multiple in previous episodes of different funds that are out there just to give you ideas i think the best thing you can do for that step one find the deal is go out and date these different investment thesis call up it's you're just wasting time a little bit of time call up 30 private equity funds and probably

smaller funds don't don't go be gone blackstone or kkr go call small time mid mid tier funds ask them what they're looking for what they like to see and maybe you can do that value ad fund go talk to banks ask them what distressed assets do you have right now that you're trying to get off your balance sheet and maybe it's real estate right maybe they've got oh we've got 13 buildings we're trying to get them off our balance sheet a lot of office space is going bad right now because of coronavirus do you think

aha maybe there's opportunity to buy some of those office buildings then we can do is go over and try to find the buyers go over and find the people that would love to buy an office building or on the pe fund go say if you want nine gyms start looking and trying to acquire gyms now you don't have money yet and that's fine that's perfect you don't want money yet you're still testing your investment thesis for traders you can do ghost trading it's one of the easy best things you can do now i know things change you have

money but if you're doing forex trading you can set up models where you ghost trade 35 million dollars and test it out for six months see how how effective your investment thesis is and maybe it's got some holes in it and you gotta tweak it you gotta edit it and you gotta say oh well we're gonna hedge against our bets here with with this trade and currency over here and you can pull on different levers and it builds your first off your confidence in your fund and secondly it actually gives you experience and

gives you practice before you go in and actually take investors money and do step three of the fun launch formula which is go out pitching investors and then step number four setting up your legal docs and actually launching the fund too many people go out and say i first step is i'm gonna set up legal docs second step i'm gonna raise money and then i'm gonna you know kind of figure out keep going on my investment thesis first step is you wanna have your investment thesis locked in you wanna have everything test

out you've looked under every rock down every nook and cranny you've figured it all out and yes i just said nook and cranny okay you've figured it all out you've gone down there and you can come to an investor confidently and pitch them your investment thesis and that's why syndications are so beautiful probably to even further test out your investment thesis is the first deal you'll do is actually going to be probably a syndication deal where you syndicate money together from multiple investors into a simple llc

it's not a fund yet it's a simple llc you go out and do the deal and ta-da you made money and your investment thesis worked and now let's scale through a fund if you guys have seen our syndication verse fund video you can go back and watch that that walks you through that process so again i'm not going to tell you what to invest in but i want to give you examples give you ideas and the frameworks for how people like us think about investing and think about playing bigger and the best funnest thing about this is

you got to go out and make decisions if there's really no cost right there's no money limitations on you because funds are so scalable you can say i don't care if the the deal is you know 7 million or 700 million i can figure out if it's a good enough deal remember back to our our lamborghini example right where my dad sat me down and said bridger we found a lamborghini in billings montana it's 50 000 and we can sell it for 150 grand this weekend could you go out and raise 50 grand and i and i've told the story

before but i say i said maybe could you talk to you know friends an uncle a former college professor or boss and raise 50 000 by saturday it's guaranteed the lamborghini's checked out we have a mechanic look at it it's all legit you'll make 150 grand this weekend if you can find that 50 000 by saturday and i said yeah i think i could do that he goes well what about a hundred thousand dollars could you find a hundred thousand dollars it's guaranteed you're gonna make a hundred grand by this weekend and i said i yeah i

think so he goes why and i go the deal is so good right if you have a good enough deal a good enough investment thesis money will find you there is so much money in this on this world especially the fed printing new trillions of dollars a day right there is so much money on this planet a lot of people think money is is is locked in there's a finite amount just to put this perspective banks regulate pretty much a lot of what happens with our currency how much money there's out there right now you can put when you put a a million

dollars into a bank account the bank can lend out 16 million dollars of loans it's called the federal reserve rate they need to reserve 1 16th of what they can make in loans so when you deposit a million dollars in your bank account they can go they essentially create 15 million dollars instantly and can put that into loans pretty interesting right and we're gonna have a whole i'm not gonna dive into the whole fed and all that stuff but money is not like when you make a dollar you're taking it

from somebody else it's not a zero-sum game there is so much money out there to be made you could carve off a hundred million dollars and no one even noticed no one even blink an eye if you carve that out of the markets right now we need to play bigger me and you and included myself included to play bigger and funs are the way to do it um especially when you have an investment piece that you've gone out and tested you can ghost model the entire thing first when finding that deal two framing it out how investors are gonna

get paid three then go and market test pitch your investors see what your investors the market says about your investment thesis and they're gonna poke holes in it maybe gotta go back and reformulate it but that is the best market testing ever and then step four of the fun launch formula is go and do your legal docs and actually launch and scale your first syndicate or your first fund so hopefully that all made sense kind of a longer episode today but i think it's important to talk about investment thesis now in the next couple

episodes i want to give you more examples of investment thesis today was kind of the overview i want to give you more examples breaking down what is an investment thesis and different types of investment thesis inside of private equity firms they have specific ones there inside of venture capital firms what type of thesis they have or hedge funds i want to break these down for you and it's going to be i think a lot of
