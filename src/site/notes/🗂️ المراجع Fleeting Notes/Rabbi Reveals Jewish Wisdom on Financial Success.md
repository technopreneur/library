well ellie

it is surprisingly difficult

to give money away without causing more

more harm than help

people don't always realize that but if

you're not sure just look at the life

history of

lottery winners who suddenly get

10 million dollars and and you see lives

almost invariably that have deteriorated

and are unrecognizably miserable

it is very very difficult

to give large sums of money or for that

many even smaller sums of money away

without causing harm rather than help

very very hard you think you know what

it takes to make a lot of money well

our next guest

knows what it takes and he knows what it

doesn't take we're going to discuss a

couple of the reasons people think

they need to have or know

to make some money

and he completely obliterates those

reasons

very insightful episode we spoke about

lessons from the bible

about money

what it takes to live a happier

more gratitude-filled life

we spoke about charity

we spoke about

the lottery you think you want to win

the lottery

after listening to what rabbi lappin

says

i don't think you're going to want to

win be like no no no i can really use

the 50 million

go easy there tiger

without further ado i give you the one

the only rabbi daniel lavin

being a jew awesome managing personal

finances not so awesome welcome to

kosher money

welcome back to kosher money privileged

to have another returning guest rabbi

daniel

lapin from south africa now living in

the states welcome back

oh south africa's a long time ago ali a

long time ago

actually i don't

pardon me i've been back to different

parts of africa as a speaker i've been

brought back to uh to various countries

but

but i've not been back to my homeland uh

since i left which is uh

about 40 years ago so

maybe we have to do a traveling tour

yeah yeah that would be interesting that

would be nicer it would be but anyway

it's great to be back here even if i

haven't been back to south africa thank

you it is good to be back with you here

at kosher money yeah i mean i i think

our other episode our first episode um

titled why are jews so wealthy

has garnered over half a million views

and streams and listens and

not to our credit i think you shared

insights in there

from your book and people were like just

let him continue talking we'll get the

whole book but uh it doesn't work that

way

um but yeah i did want to cover and and

you mentioned in the previous episode

that

there are erroneous thoughts as to why

jews are wealthy and you list out a

handful of them yes in the in the

episode but i'd like to talk about one

you know one that comes to mind

when people think oh there are

reasons as to why jews are wealthy

what are some of the

mistaken reasons

well one of them is

intelligence that jews are smart

and

this one was remarkably easy to debunk

because first of all

uh while jewish iq on average and you

know and iq is very much a statistical

um

characteristic really but um

although jewish iq on average generally

speaking uh is higher than average

um the it's not the highest in the

united states

any anymore so that's number one uh

although jewish financial achievement

still remains number one in terms of a

discrete demographic group

um the second thing is that uh

you know our mothers all told us i'm

sure your mother your mother went to the

same mothering school as mine did and

you know she probably said to you at

some point in time or another um ellie

stop being too smart for your own good

you know something like that um

being overly smart

is a drawback in human relationships and

business and making money if nothing is

all about human relationships and in

general you know i think we all feel

this when when we're in negotiation or

discussion with somebody who's much much

smarter than we are you kind of feel

like there's an agenda maybe going on

you're not privy to you don't really

know what's going on so we're not

comfortable and the evidence is that

it's very simple that is that the

smartest people in america go and work

on the faculties of universities

and anybody in the financial services

business knows that nobody but nobody is

worse with money than folks on the

faculties of universities academics so

so no uh

the idea that um that that iq and

brilliance is is a help it isn't now the

other end isn't either forrest gump is

an old movie from many years ago about a

a guy sort of

very low iq guy but a lovable guy who

becomes a tycoon it's important to

remember that's a movie it's not reality

the intelligence distribution curve you

know is a typical bell-shaped

distribution and at the very low end um

people do not do very well at money but

at the very high eye and they do equally

badly

the the model of bill gates or warren

buffett are outliers

the norm is the sam waltons of the world

ordinary guy like you and me a guy who

drove a pickup truck

and just just an ordinary guy but

you know hard-working and who

understands how the world really works

that's important

and and of course that is the the jewish

secret

so you've listed many others in your

book and i've read part of your book and

it's super insightful and i know the

book by the way is called thou shall

prosper and it's not the only book

right another one is business secrets

from the bible and i mentioned that

because otherwise how do we sell books

yes and i do want to actually get into

that

during the course of this episode

um

i know you you have a podcast right um

the rabbi daniel lapin show the rabbi

daniel lapin showed this yes and you

mentioned the five f's

what are those and what should people

know about it

this is really

tremendously important

it's very easy to

dissipate

the most valuable commodity we have

which is time

everything else

you know

we can manage with time is what is the

real shortage commodity and so it's

really important uh in in in every

aspect of successful living to make sure

that time counts

and

and that means one has to identify what

are the most important things in life

and um i i distill them into five f's uh

just to make them easy to remember and

uh

i have a new book coming out soon on

that and

and and and and here's the the the

important thing helly a car

is not you know

i like cars

a terrific car isn't a car with uh

german brembo brakes but allows the

engine

what makes a really great car is the

smooth integration of everything so you

know hyundai makes a fairly decent car

one of its models if

if i bought that car took out the engine

and put in a mercedes-benz amg uh six

liter engine

it's not going to make the car any

better because it's not going to

integrate with the transmission and the

suspension that's what's really

important

successful living is the same way

exactly the same thing and the the five

areas that if you get these things right

you should literally be praying without

any

diversion three times a day filled with

gratitude to our boss you've got no

complaints in life what are the five f's

in no particular order because they they

need to be visualized as an integrated

system so the order is insignificant in

no particular order

finance

family

faith

friendships

and fitness

and and the the part that that takes a

little bit of work

is understanding

um how family is vital to

finances and how faith is actually

important when it comes to fitness and

so it is how all of these things

integrate to provide a complete system

but let's face it if you have a

wonderful marriage and a terrific family

and you got no financial worries to keep

you

awake at night and you've got good

friends

and thank god you're in good health

and you have a connection with god faith

being the last one

you don't have a lot to complain about

in life

those are my five f's i teach them and

focus on them and i do coaching groups

and uh

mind groups on that because that's what

what's really important people don't

always know that if you know if you want

a terrific family

there are other things you have to focus

on as well if you want a terrific bank

account you can't just focus exclusively

on that

we are holistic beings hashem god made

us into complicated

images of him

in which totality and unity is is hugely

important what do you rabbi lapin do to

stay cognizant of the five f's

practically right when you go through

the week it's very easy to be habitual

are you pulling out some sort of system

that you're visualizing and saying okay

where am i holding every sunday as it

pertains to these five f's what are you

doing and what can you teach the

audience to improve their 5s yes

well what i recommend is that everybody

does this everybody should carry

every day you replenish it every morning

you know about twenty three by five

index cards and you tuck them together

with an elastic band always color

matched to your tie and okay that parts

are important and um

and that way um at the end of every day

you're able to take you see it's an idea

capture device anything that occurs to

you anybody you meet

a to-do project something occurs to you

during the day

um it's you know you take out a phone

and try and tap it into your phone

you've interrupted a conversation

and and you know here we are talking if

if you stimulate me to an idea which you

always do and i grab my phone i'm no

longer with you but if i take out my

index cards and while we're talking i

just take

it hasn't interrupted the conversation

and so um i i do that and at the end of

of every day i i run through it i i i do

a journal i actually

write down and and this is a hugely

important thing for progress in life

financially as well as anything else um

you know it's interesting to note it's

funny is it not that winston churchill

when

when when he passed on we were able to

look at his journal

and see everything he wrote day by day

the during the intense period of world

war ii every single day he was busy

journaling

and

so many famous people in history left

journals

you know how come the bus driver

of the number five bus

um you know in

in in lawrence kansas where's his

journal well here's the thing it's not

that famous people

happen miraculously to have left

journals but the act of writing a

journal

makes you more likely to be a person of

uh of stunning achievement and success

so so that's a very important thing and

i i i do have

my journals laid out in terms of of my

five f's and and i monitor and there are

times where i need to focus a little

more on on family you know maybe there's

a week where something's going on uh or

i have to i think to myself you know

what i've

i need to focus on the fitness side and

but generally speaking

you're trying to make sure that

that you're progressing on all you don't

want to be like um

a

tour de france bicycle racer with these

massive developed legs that look like

oak trees you know and these spindly

little arms because you only need to

hold the handlebars but you need to be

fully developed and and this this

happens you know we we have a value uh

in ancient jewish wisdom as i call it of

shleimut meaning totality completion

it's related to the word shalom which is

peace

peace and tranquility and harmony come

from the overall and uniform development

of the complete entity

i would imagine

during your work and traveling and

speeches and seminars and interviews

people have asked you

what is the secret to

blank what is the secret to a happy

marriage what is the secret to a

successful business what is the secret

to making a lot of money

is there is there

a general theme to how you answer them

and

what what is the answer

um my answer is tremendously

unsatisfactory and uh and wins me no

prizes um but but at least i have the uh

the advantage of of retaining my

veracity

in the sense that

i tell the truth on this uh the notion

that there is one secret to anything

trivializes life that's that's not the

life we live that's not the world in

which god placed us

um

and and so perhaps the one big secret of

marriage is knowing that there is not

one big secret to marriage

uh what's the you know what's the one

most important thing about trying to

increase my income and increase my

revenue well one most important thing is

to know that there is not only one

important thing

and uh and the 5f program i think sort

of

emulates that that same idea that

you can't oversimplify life

you can't oversimplify anything

you know

women's perfumes are very complicated

compounds

and

one of the uh

one of the most important ingredient in

an expensive perfume is something called

ambergris

ambergris is from the interstein of a

whale

when my family and i sailed our boat

across the pacific a few years back and

we actually saw ambergris floating

around had i known how expensive it was

we'd have stopped the boat and hauled

some out but the stuff stinks i mean

it's it's really unpleasant stuff

vitally important ingredient in a high

quality perfume

you know i'm an ignoramus i decided to

go into the perfume business and you

know i like oil of roses and i'll even

stretch to musk oil i mean i don't like

killing a musk deer to get the gland but

fine i'll do that but i draw the line at

the stinky ambergris stuff i'm gonna

fail

complicated things have many different

ingredients and leaving one out can be

fatal is that to say that there aren't

common denominators with the elon musk

bill gates mark zuckerberg's of the

world and

if

not what are some of the common

denominators in

very successful people's successful

marriages

um sure so did i just ask the same

question but in a different way yeah oh

okay yeah so i'm going in circles here

no it's not i mean i i think by raising

those people uh you you're in a sense

giving the jewish version of what little

kids are sometimes told in in

uh in you know

little kids uh you know you can become a

basketball player and you'll get out of

this neighborhood and you're gonna

really make it

look that little kid has got as much

chance of playing for the nba as i do

actually probably maybe a bit more but

certainly as much chance as

a jewish kid has of becoming an elon

musk or a

bill gates

look

dropping out of harvard before you

graduate and

is is really not the avenue to success

unless

you were born on the cusp of or you came

of age on the cusp of the computer

revolution

your mother was on the board of ibm

which was the dominant computer company

of the time and and your dad was one of

the prominent and influential

lawyers of of the united states of

america that for those stars to all

align makes you build gates

but the fact is you really do not have

to become bill gates to be astonishingly

successful

and so i encourage people to put those

pictures out of your mind completely um

i

um i'm not very good at dancing at

weddings actually i'm not very good at

dancing at all

this is just not a big strength of mine

now um

could a dancing teacher improve me

i would say absolutely there's no

question about it that if i if i had a

good teacher uh i'd get a whole lot

better than i am would i el would i ever

become

you know rudolph nuriev

it's ridiculous

i don't have to aspire to that i just

have to aspire to looking a little less

like a drunk trying to stamp on

cockroaches

and so it is financially don't have to

aspire to mark zuckerberg

better you don't

um but you should aspire to

[Music]

significant

financial success and security

so when people hear that to achieve or

strive to achieve

financial success they say does hashem

does god want that from me right

money is inherently dirty money of

course abundance of it is

completely materialistic yes that's not

what god wants for me he wants me to

study torah he wants me to do

good things but

if i'm spending my time

focusing on

that

financial that f in the in the five f's

i'm doing something wrong is that is

that the right way of thinking or the

wrong way

well um for a start i'll i'll say that

you're not the only one asking that it's

an astonishingly

common

uh paradigm and

not only in our faith but even among my

christian friends and you know that i i

have many christian friends and i spend

a lot of time

in the christian world

it's it's prevalent there as well where

we're many many good and wonderful

people

feel that somehow

um

the love i have for god

right and and they they do and we do we

love our god

for his goodness and his greatness and

his giving and his abundance

and and his kindness and his strength

and so

we we

we easily reached the point of feeling

well you know i'm i'm connecting with

him i'm becoming more spiritual and that

means i have to remove myself from what

we call the the gushmias you know from

the materialistic part of life this is

very very common and and something we we

experience and encounter a great deal um

and and it's a huge problem because

um it it is based on a misunderstanding

it's based on a misunderstanding of the

holistic aspect of life but but more

than that it's it's based on a

misunderstanding

of what hashem what god wants for us

uh you only have to first of all ask the

question where did money come from

like was god distracted by some trouble

in the middle east and when he next

looked down

oh no look at those dreadful human

beings you know they've created this

thing money oh we're gonna no that's not

only is that not part of it but

money is actually from god it is part of

his

plan

for human interaction

really how do you know that that's

pretty obvious

there are more laws concerning money in

the torah than there are about

kosher food dietary laws

for heaven's sake we've we've got a a

hugely important and and significant

book

in day-to-day jewish life called the

it's the code of jewish law

and more than you know there are four

volumes one of those volumes

is the mishpatis the law is the volume

having to do with finances

and i say a bit more than a quarter is

financial because it's pretty big

it's it's a big one

and one of those books is evan eiser

that's the other family

so

so yes

money is part

of god's plan

look um as people in government discover

giving away other people's money is

really fun

spending other people's money is really

fun

but um god tells us to give away our own

right

in deuteronomy chapter 15

the rules about how to interact with

poor people

what poor means actually

and um you can't give anything away if

you don't have

but there's even so much more to that

you know the uh

the whole idea of um

uh

of falling into the trap you allude to

it and and it's easy you know because

in the the fourth chapter of pirkei

obviously the fourth chapter of the

mishna we call ethics of the fathers

we have

who is wealthy

right and the mishna says he who is

happy

with his lot

and it's very easy to say well you see

let's

let's do a podcast about creating wealth

and now that we've got everyone's

attention

we'll say we're going to devote the rest

of today's show about learning how to be

content with what we have and that way

everyone's going to be wealthy because

commissioner says who is wealthy he who

is happy

not with what he has

but with his helac

with his portion

so that raise is very complicated mishna

which by the way pirkei about is not

found in you know in kochem it's found

in the cedar of naziki and it's found in

the part of the mishnah having to do

with finances

you know so don't make the mistake of

thinking that ethics of the fathers

isn't about money it is

and who is wealthy not who is happy with

what he has because that would define

a vagrant living in his tent on broadway

right no

[Music]

happy with his portion so we've got to

define what a portion is

and more than that

each of these statements in that mission

is followed up with a quote from

scripture what is the quote here

through the work of your hands you will

eat

then you will be happy and it will be

well with you

so this is not by any means the way i

misunderstood it oh listen just be happy

with what you've got and you learn the

art of happiness and contentment and

you'll be as wealthy as no that's simply

not true

we're talking money here we're not

talking philosophical concepts we're not

talking mindsets and a great deal of

stress and and unhappiness

in in parts of the orthodox world uh you

know we talk about the the the

educational crisis and everything else a

lot of the unhappiness and stress flows

from the mistakes we're talking about

where where people are tragically

downplaying

the the f of finance

introducing a sponsor message we'll be

right back to this week's episode but

first could we do the do-do-do every

single time i don't know if we it's a

special you have to keep it short please

could you please just cut that out and

put that into every okay

so

i'm in the process of of buying home i

mean i've been looking for a home for a

long time and we don't have to get into

nitty gritty's where i'm going but what

i do want to say is

it is so complicated to buy a house

you've done it you probably have blocked

out what you need to do there's so many

moving parts you want a good lawyer you

want a good inspector you want a good

mortgage guy and that's why

i love shmuelsheiwitz

when it comes to mortgages there's a

billion things to learn and you can't

just you know learn it all in in one

sitting it's literally

you know i know we did a an episode on

it but it's still it's as helpful as it

was it's not enough to really

understand and you really need someone

looking out for you and taking care of

you i was talking a friend of mine and i

was talking to him about the rates and

you let's let's uh you play my friend

let's go hey

yakov he doesn't sound like that you

have to do something no uh hey friend uh

what are you what rates did you get oh

rates are

astronomically high in 2020 yeah but

there's different options because you

don't have to lock in right away you

could wait a little you could buy damp

you got your your mortgage guide and

tell you about that you mentioned

something or whatever we wanted to close

pretty quickly exactly that is the type

of you know

mortgage guy that is

he's okay but at the end of the day you

want someone you're a spanish moshe yeah

you want someone like shmuel who

literally i'm on the phone with him i'm

talking to him i'm not sure he's like

ask anything you want he takes care of

you and that's my experience when it

comes to home buying when it comes to

anything real estate he's just as

transparent honest and he's good at what

he does

you know when someone says i will get

you the best and i will try my best and

very open and honest that's what you

need we gotta get you an i love small

shy witch t-shirt i would wear that you

would right i don't know if my wife

would be so happy like what yeah yeah

okay and my wife yeah i love she will

shy with somebody there you go

uh that's really cool really cool he's

an awesome dude search up his name click

on the news section in google he's

featured in articles pretty much weekly

giving his insights and he can only have

those insights because of his almost

three decades of experience

so look it up approved

funding

approvedfunding.com mortgages

tell him your friends at kosher money

sent you

and without further ado

and if you do that

what does he give you a free t-shirt no

i mean maybe he'll do that also but

he'll he'll drop the the costs of the oh

yes yes he does have incentives

for our listeners

he'll drop the bank fees and without

further ado

back to rabbi lapin

so we're talking here about

different scriptures different mishnais

that are of course biblical so

is there and i know you have a book

about this and i'd like to talk about

biblical

secrets for making money

if you were to open up

a mishnayis

the talmud

what are

verses what are secrets that are within

that people should know about in order

to increase their income

here is um why

i like to joke that everybody needs a

rabbi it's not just because i like to

stay fully employed

it's because

like any technical topic

it requires considerable effort

and dedication in order to extract the

information you need

the way that god's book is laid out

is much more like the human brain

than like an encyclopedia

or like google today for instance you

know if i want to look up finance on

google

my problem will be how many

uh

hits there will be

it i'm gonna have to find a way of

homing in and narrowing it down because

it it just fights too much if you look

up finance on an encyclopedia you'll go

to the f page and it'll take you to find

it you got it

but

the the torah is laid out more the way

the human brain is there isn't a

particular you cannot identify the group

of cells or neurons in the brain uh that

holds the information on uh

um

you know your your children's names

we it's all over the place it's a little

bit like the way information data is

is placed on a computer hard drive on a

or a solid-state drive once again it's

all over the place and there are

complicated algorithms for retrieving

what is needed

it's a little bit like that so

um

you you and and i make that that point

ellie because

uh you and i could both in in just a few

minutes

pull out a verse

to say whatever you wanted to say you

know find me a verse or a reference that

poverty is good yeah you know

bread and and water you should live on

and sure enough i can find that

um

find me that that wealth is okay yeah i

got that as well you know uh the thing

is to be able to assemble the entire

tapestry

and um and and from the the stepping

back the overall picture studying the

spiritual topography of the torah you

then are able to to to understand the

direction of this game there's a reason

that the same volume that that we both

love and that i alluded to earlier

pirkei about the ethics of the father

speaks about

make for yourself a rabbi it doesn't say

buy encyclopedias or buy books

you everybody needs because this is a

transmission it's an oral torrent it's a

toraja balpair and and the transmission

means that it's very helpful to be

initiated into it by somebody who was

initiated into it by his father or by

his teacher or hers so um

and and so that's why uh i you know i

didn't hand out an index card with the

one secret of making money

i had to write some books i had to to

develop some online teaching programs so

people can

wrap themselves around the whole thing

but but you know one

one thing i'd i'd start on perhaps

is um the idea of

of connection

hugely important

if you ask what was hashem's plan what

was god's plan with money what did he

intend

yeah we we know what the idea of it is

we get it

we we understand that the very popular

slang term for money found in many

cultures by the way bread

you know can you lend me some bread

or have you got any dough on you

it's straight out of the first couple of

chapters of genesis

now they reference sourdough that's the

latest craze so for money no

that's what we're getting that's what

most the latest craze yeah yeah all

right but this relationship this

understanding that uh that uh bread

is a biblical stand-in for money yeah

that that's that that is straight out of

uh

torah thinking and so

uh so yes we do know that um that god's

plan is that people shouldn't be alone

and isolated

because lonely and isolated people live

poor and short lives

it's not good

how do we connect with people

well i don't think it's necessarily very

good to do business with friends

but it's wonderful to make friends out

of business associates i like that

and

people do it all the time um i i had the

the joy of being at the wedding of a

daughter of a disciple of a student of

mine last night

and um

the father of the bride um is a

prominent businessman

and a lot of the guests at the wedding

who were going up to him and dancing

with him and giving him a big hug

business associates

and uh and so

god gives us two ways out of the

existential torment

of aloneness

and one of them is marriage and family

and the other one is

is making money

and they are both pleasurable in

different ways

so you describe how one's ability to

make money is proportional to the number

of people who know you like you trust

you do business with

many introverts are listening

are they doomed is there

a way that they can be prosperous and be

successful

if it doesn't come easy to them yeah

um

so

here here is the thing i think it's

important to to bear in mind

um

the

the book of ruth miguel at ruth

is

chronologically located

he wrote it between shafting between

judges and shmuel even though we have it

in

not

but that's where

it is a segway between those two books

and the book of judges ends

by ami mahem en melech be israel

ish

in those days there was no king in

israel

everyone did

that which was right in his eyes

you can tell this there's something of a

societal breakdown here this is this is

this is not setting us up for good news

at all

and now we open with the first verse of

the book of ruth

and we have um uh

and hazal explained that that means that

that not the days the judge is judged

that's a different construction in

hebrew this means the day the judges

were judged

by who the litigants they didn't like

what the judges said they went and

demonstrated outside their residences

and their if you can imagine such an

astonishing breakdown of society um

that's how the book of ruth starts and

the very next phrase by ira of baarez

and there was a famine in the land

and

oddly enough in a very unusual way we

now meet the protagonists with no names

the next verse tells us there was this

guy

and and he had a wife also anonymous and

he had two sons also anonymous it's not

until a little later that we find out

their names this is a lot like the the

book of exodus opens because we don't

call the book of exodus exodus in hebrew

it's shamath the book of names

paradoxically the second chapter of the

book of names begins with and a man from

the house of levi went and married a

woman from the house of liber like any

names hello anybody what did they put on

the invitation you know and uh and then

they had a baby and the mom looked at

the baby and she said

nice looking kid like is there ever a

mother in history that didn't look at a

kid and said no you know what is this

and then um

they have to put him in a river in the

in the nile because we're living under a

dreadful tyranny and um

she uh

puts her

the the kids the baby's older sister

is put you know watches her name yeah no

her name neither and then comes princess

anonymous the daughter of pharaoh

the very first time a name shows up

is she princess the daughter of pharaoh

takes moses look after him and uh the

anonymous sister says oh i can find you

an anonymous jewish woman who'll take

care of the baby as a nanny like no

names until finally the daughter of

pharah says yeah let's call him moses

and the very next verse after that

begins the deliverance moses goes out

and kills his first egyptian right there

no names is a sign of societal breakdown

it means no connection no communication

obviously under pharaoh's tyranny uh and

in any form of slavery human

connectivity suffers badly and in the

days of the book of ruth yeah same thing

and sure enough we see that he he wasn't

a person who wanted to be connected to

his people he was detached

but the whole rest of the book of ruth

is the story of connection

until it ends with the

hierarchical

description of the genealogy from

parrots the son of yahudah and tamar all

the way to the ultimate king of israel

david melech israel king of israel the

the book is a book of connectivity and

and i'll just tell you one other thing

that's beautiful in terms of this

because if we're talking about one thing

that is not necessarily

um a part of how our people always think

you know

can you believe it the the the rambam

brings down the rules if you're in the

middle of praying

and somebody comes up and talks to you

like what do we do

go away it's wrong you actually have to

interrupt the prayer and talk to him

which we know from when abraham was

talking to god and the three angels come

along who he thinks are three people and

he says to god hey god excuse me i've

got to take care of these people.

connection is what god wants us to do

but it's not how we automatically think

and and um interestingly enough you know

although only about 50 percent of the

verses in tanakh begin with the word and

which our english teachers told us not

to do in the book of ruth 90 of the

verses begin with above nine zero nine

zero ninety percent of them uh because

it's a book of connection the book is is

four chapters that lead us from no name

no connection to the ultimate in love

and and

and and human affection and ultimately

connection so

yeah so one thing

um i would i would speak about and do a

lot is that uh we don't

think seriously about

um

the number the the number and the

quality of our friends and of our

connections and of our associates and we

know we certainly don't work um

meticulously on building that i'm not

talking about facebook friends i'm

talking about real friends

people who return your call within 24

hours

so you're saying even if someone's not

an extrovert and they're introvert if

they focus on the quality this is yeah

right this is like um

uh you know if i if i meet a football

player and he's walking around with a

cost and i say hey what happened to you

he said i broke my leg

when did this happen

um

seven years ago you haven't played for

seven years no no i'm i i'm no longer a

football player i'm a broken leg guy no

you get it fixed up right right a

teenager has uh

acne and pimples you know teenagers will

spend the equivalent of the gross

domestic product of half the countries

in the united nations on pharmaceuticals

to clear up their faces they don't just

walk around and say hi i'm a pimply guy

you fix things that are wrong and

somehow the idea of introverted

and and yes there is such a thing i mean

there are people who get restored and

re-energized by uh by being alone there

are other people getting restored and

re-energized by being with other people

i get all that but being excited about

meeting new people um loving other human

beings

really really loving them i mean imagine

how different your whole understanding

of customer service is

with that when somebody walks into a

post office

right you do not get the sense that the

people behind the counter love you

but when you walk into fedex

very often in a good fedex location

you they really care about you they want

your package to get to where it's going

when you when you can make yourself

actually feel good about other human

beings your whole attitude of service

your whole attitude of business

everything is different so

so yes even

you know i i think of of friends that

i've helped make the transition from

colell from an advanced uh study program

into the wonderful world of business

um and and it really is important right

because if if you've been studying torah

and you're in your mid-20s or early 30s

the notion that then you're going to

become an actuary or a dentist it's it's

a long shot it's very very very draining

very very difficult but god has provided

a beautiful substitute it's called

business

and you can get into that

literally within a week

it changes everything and one of the

things that that i focus on are

exercises

of connectivity how to join up basically

you know lessons from the book of ruth

how did how to build associations and

build connections that are authentic i

don't know if you have them have you

ever seen these monthly business

development meetings you go

you know the second wednesday of every

month you have a breakfast meeting

everybody exchanges business cards and

networking stay away from them stay away

from them i mean who wants to spend

breakfast surrounded by venal hungry

ambitious people

right you know rather go to a uh the

board of directors meeting of a local

charity or the rotary club

and you'll be with people who are

actually trying to do something valuable

and then you do business with them and

sure enough much much much much more

real business is contracted when you are

surrounded by people who are givers than

people who are eagerly scanning the room

for a new customer

right there's so many offshoots of

things you've said that i want to go and

so

you're friends with dave ramsey you've

been a fan of his for many years

you've been interviewed you interviewed

him

is there something you've learned from

him whether money or about people that

you think is part of the reason he is

successful well the same mishna we

alluded to before not only says who is

wealthy uh he who is happy with his

portion but also says he who is who is

wise

um

he who

learns from every person

but

you think to yourself is that i mean do

i really learn from every person no if

you again look at the verse it's david

amalek saying me call malam dai his

culti doesn't say from every human being

i become wise i've become wise from

those people who had something to teach

me so dave dave ramsey has plenty to

teach and approve our previous

conversation um i think if i had to

identify one

wonderful thing about dave is uh

um his ebullient and effervescent love

of humanity of people he really does

and um when when he meets somebody or

talks to somebody and i've seen him do

this somebody who who reveals debt and

mountains of debt and the person is just

worn down

he feels he feels that the the sadness

really permeates him

and conversely he he delights and finds

joy when people using his system break

free of debt so

he

i think what i learned is something i

also learned from the great master

salesman zig ziglar who was a dear

friend

um

they they really they not only love

folks but their faces show it you know

we have a jewish principal i have emma

cabello that called now i'm meeting

people but save her pandemia for you

know meet people with a nice face

and i'm

not nearly as good at this as i am but

dave encourages me and zig encouraged me

um

it's important to be aware of your of

your

expression and of your face check it in

the mirror you know ask your your spouse

or your kids to to tell you when you're

you're frowning um and and i i don't

smile enough or you know i tend to be

much more

fire and brimstone in certain ways so um

no it's important to to

show people to actually love folks and

and to show them that you care about

them and you love them so that's a

really important part of of the entire

process of uh

finding a foothold in the wonderful

world of business

i want to talk um

self-help books leadership books

for a moment i've read books to be a

better leader to be a better

communicator and they're great in the

moment

though

do they have long lasting effect and if

not what can someone actually

practically do to become a better leader

a better communicator a better person

so um

zig ziglar used to say

you have to

reread them regularly he says everyone

needs a shower but you don't take one

and call it you know you gotta you gotta

renew it

and so that's what he used to say and i

think there's something to that um

a lot of people have difficulty reading

books which is why by the way audio

books are a wonderful invention

but

hearing or reading something twice is is

even more difficult so

talking about

communication

um to give you one example yes look

if i had to identify

what is the single most important

part of my body

for

doing business and making a living

and other than the brain you know and my

soul and so but in terms of the visible

body

i would say mouth

you know unless you are a swimwear model

a job for which i once applied

and got turned down

i can't i can't imagine why well it's

because of anti-semitism

it just shows that anti-semitism is

alive and well

but

um uh

but yeah the mouth

to be able to

articulate and um

one of the reasons that i i often tell

people who are lucky enough to be

invited to give a speech never

read your speech don't don't take notes

and and sort of have them then look you

mustn't do that and and there are

techniques that i teach for getting over

that because nobody wants to read what

your speech writer wrote

nobody wants to hear you read what your

speech writer wrote what if you wrote it

and even if you wrote it it doesn't

matter because a speech you have a long

time to sit and figure it out

but when you're talking to somebody or

you're speaking to an audience directly

you feel you're gaining a glimpse into

the person's soul

and and in fact you really are

and um and so one of the ways to be able

to

articulate more effectively

um is

again using a torah principle using a a

fundamental idea from

the

the whole

technology of torah in a sense is look

um our understanding of speech is very

very basic it takes us all the way back

to the beginning of the torah the book

of genesis

and it says

god breathed into adam's nose the breath

of life

ancient jewish wisdom teaches that god

at that point gives him the ability to

speak

and

and

we we have an understanding that that is

the moment from which the calendar

begins

so we're in the year 57 82 it's that how

that's how many years ago not that adam

was formed or that uh no from when he

opened his mouth to start speaking

that's how important it is and

and so is there a way to develop

our ability to speak absolutely

um one is stop other with the exception

of the kosher money podcast stop

watching so much

video

stop watching movies

it's it's tremendously damaging to our

ability because it it energizes a

passivity in an oxymoronic kind of a way

it makes us passive recipients there's

no mental pro everything is fed to us

you're not even exercising your

imagination because it's all pictures

that's why your mom and my mom told us

stop watching tv read a book

because the understanding was that the

cognitive process of reading a book

makes you a better person a more

effective person you want to improve the

your ability to articulate cut back on

watching time and

read from a good book aloud

in english

for half an hour

four times a week

spend two hours a week

letting your own ears hear what your own

lips and tongues and mouths articulate

and

within about two or three months

even if you don't notice that your

friends are gonna say you know what are

you you swallowed the dictionary you're

sounding it's you sounding good it's not

easy to follow the discipline but force

yourself to read aloud

for four half-hour sessions every week

and your ability to

it's hugely important for for business

success it dawned on me as you were

saying this the power of communication

moshe moses

our greatest leader had a speech

impediment and yet he still connected

with the audience because he was

speaking from his heart there was a

certain connection there that touched

people regardless of how he was

sounding when he spoke

right this is a guy who starts off when

we meet him with a speech impediment

right and when we say goodbye to him

he's just finished talking non-stop for

30 days the entire book of deuteronomy

right how do you go from a speech

impediment to a 30-day speech

by having a vision and a purpose

beautiful yeah beautiful so we're right

now in june 2022 and

it's no secret that families the country

the world is struggling with inflation

there's an effect on household expenses

businesses are are struggling to keep up

their price increases and then you throw

in private school tuition yeshiva

tuition and other costs of orthodox

jewish living such as kosher pricing

what do you what message do you have for

families at a time like this

hey

be happy with what you got no no no no

just absolutely not um we can do a whole

lot better than that

first of all i

i

say

please divide the problem into two

let's look at short term and long term

right only the biden administration had

the audacity and the gaul to say that

inflation is transitory and that it's

caused by the russian president no we

know what causes inflation there is only

one thing and that is printing money and

quantitative easing which is a

behind-the-scenes way of doing exactly

the same thing when the government wants

to spend money it doesn't have and it

wants to tax indirectly because raising

taxes one of the best ways of raising

taxes invisibly is inflation's print

money and you're basically taking money

out of our pockets and anybody who's

gone to the market recently knows or

filled up your car at the gas station

you know that that's exactly what's

happened um but but we do understand

what's going on

and uh we don't

think it's transitory we don't think

that we're going to magically um you

know wake up uh on uh air of tish above

and it's gonna be uh

instantly so it's not like that it's a

longer lasting problem and so let's

divide our challenge into two

immediate

short term meaning over the next few

weeks you know how do we deal with the

rising expenses and slightly longer term

what are we going to do about it the

longer term is

is is a little bit easier because

the only reliable way

to deal with inflation is to make

more money the government is basically

taking away more of your money it's as

if your tax rate suddenly went up and if

you would actually

use children's blocks

to represent a sum of money and show

okay this is my uh before tax income

10 years ago this is my before tax

income now hopefully it's it's higher

than 10 years ago and now let's look at

what tax took out of it 10 years ago and

we end up with what i

can spend as mine over here and let's do

the same thing here you discover oops

although my my

tower of bricks representing my

gross income is more what i'm actually

left with is less

so

the only solution to that is you have to

make more money

and and that's what my books are about

that's what we're talking about um there

are ways to increase your income there

are ways to enhance your revenue

listen getting out of debt really

important dave ramsey is the only person

in the world you want to talk to if

you're in debt

absolutely

investing money you have

speak to fidelity or one of those guys

there's plenty people who help you

invest but if your problem is

i'm just

i'm i'm being buried here i just i just

don't

you have to make more money you gotta

how

okay well we'll we'll come to that in

just a moment

if i may let's go back to the short term

problem what do you do short term

short term you have to cut expenses

now this

takes real courage now

you know there are certain things

there are human characteristics that are

not default conditions

the default condition for for all

mammals and for all human beings is

cowardice not courage

that's the default

but uh moshe rabbanu had to speak to

your sure

and

and he had to say to him

be strong and of good courage hey if

that came naturally

and that gets repeated a few times

if it came naturally that would no

courage is hugely difficult to achieve

but very important for successful living

to be able to to face our uh our

challenges instead of

averting our eyes from them hoping

they'll go away if we don't confront

them no not at all and that's and that's

why the phrase

which is horribly translated as on that

self same day

is the the word use the phrase used for

noah getting into the ark you know you

know what happened i mean people have

been threatening noah for more than a

hundred years while he's been building

the ark

and uh

and god says to know okay

like it's noon time get into the ark

noah says god haven't quite finished

packing and and you know what i'm still

i got to find one zebra how about

we

give me 12 hours we'll we'll board the

ark at midnight well i know why he says

that because all the folks said to noah

listen we don't know if it's going to

rain or not but if it does and you try

getting the ark we'll kill you you're

going nowhere

right he he wasn't popular at all

and so god says no i'm sorry you can

have to go in the middle of the day in

front of everybody stand erect confront

them walk right in

god says to abraham circumcise yourself

right

go ahead

um what now god said yeah now middle of

the day which is why we have brief

midnight right to this day we don't do

them in the night time uh abram says

back to god this is part of my uh

edition you won't find this in the text

but abraham says to god listen i got but

i've got to get a caterer i'm going to

get the moil i mean it's going to take

me time i suggest we do this at about 11

o'clock tonight i know why he says that

because he lives in a culture where

mutilating the body in any way shape or

form is is undoable today of course we

live in a time where mutilating young

people's bodies is fine for everything

except brit mila

but

god says no got to do it now

standing erect and confronting the

challenges is a hugely important part of

successful living and i didn't we see

from abraham avraham that he was vyash

kemba boker he did get up early with his

with his zealousness that is admirable

that's exactly right yeah which is you

know if you're if you're feeling less

than courageous about problems you have

in life

um you stay in bed late in the morning

and doctors say oh you got depression a

little depression i'm i'm just

letting myself go that's all

happiness is like that as well

right the torah says you've got to be

happy happiness is not a natural

condition

exuding misery i want to share with you

all my problems that's the natural

condition which is a horrible thing to

do imagine marrying somebody and

discovering that they've never learned

the principle of happiness and you're

now stuck with a miserable person it's

awful it's a terrible thing

so things like happiness and courage are

are things that god expects us to

develop and i i say that because

the immediate short-term problem of

dealing with inflation requires courage

i'll give you

an example

covert

taught the jewish community that a

young man and a young woman can actually

build their life together and have a

marriage in a backyard

for about 75

right i know some beautiful young

couples

who are proud of showing me their

pictures

of the marriage in the parents backyard

because they were living in an area

where gatherings were prohibited

but you and i have friends

we have families

what do people spend on weddings don't

tell me

now if the person is

is

very comfortable like the wedding i have

played a role in last night uh great god

bless them good luck to them

but for the rest of the folks for whom

making a marriage you know you've got

six kids

three of them are girls

um

and you worry

the cost of a wedding

you know what

it's going to take a lot of courage

backyard wedding is just fine

we've told you about them and we're

going to tell you again

the longest running charity in israel

they're giving out free push guns we

have a link in the show notes if you're

watching on youtube or in your podcast

app click on the link get a free pushka

this is what it looks like if you're

watching on youtube it's colorful it's

beautiful and we want it to be full so

grab a pushka it's a mayor balanese

organization so

everyone knows the ritual if you lose

something you dedicate money to mayor

balanese in the hopes of finding it give

your money

um and they've been doing this since

1788 i actually was on uh

in a house recently and i walked in and

this colorful push girl was sitting

there and i said hey where did you

where'd you

where'd you learn where where do you uh

learn about kolkata she's like i've been

getting it for years

so this place has been around

and i'm excited that more and more

people are donating you don't need to

get the push get to donate you can go to

their website

dot org slash kosher money

see all they do to help israel's

neediest and

we appreciate that you are helping one

of the kosher money sponsors but more

importantly helping the needy of israel

now back to this week's episode

something more real there's something

more

pure i guess the weddings of yesteryear

thinking back to europe um with these

backyard weddings this is something else

i mean i mean i read mishpache magazine

they're expected gifts

in the room the person is supposed to

give the color a gift

jewelry

i mean the stuff adds up

says who who who who established these

rules

you've got to have courage and you've

got to stand and say you know what we're

breaking this there is a system of

living in the code of jewish law

i keep that

but the customs that are added on in

order to sort of maintain social

sorry not doing those

um another one um

we our family goes but we do our

vacation boating in british columbia

and uh just at the start of a beautiful

beautiful inlet between tall

snow-covered mountains um are called

princess luisa inlet louisa inlet

there's a there's a camp run by a

christian organization young life is the

camp

and and we've we've gone by there

occasionally and

i mean they have a lovely time the

children come from all around the

country and they're they're able to spit

how long do children go to camp for

one week

how long do our children go to camp for

three weeks five weeks six weeks

says who

tuition killing you

there's something called homeschooling

people say that's not so practical in

today's time when yeah it's only only

about two million children in the united

states of america are doing it

how many orthodox

well more and more happily i'm proud to

say um

my wife and i uh i think certainly

helped to influence the trend in that

direction how many if i had to guess how

many orthodox jewish children are

homeschooling today

um

a few hundred

yeah it's it's much more practical than

people think and when

i mean i hear what people pay

for private look you can't send your

children to gigs

right a gecko is a government

indoctrination camp it's an institution

that used to be called a public school

you can't send your children to a geek

out of the question

today

it's literally

you're kissing your children goodbye

you're saying you're you're saying their

souls simply don't matter

so you have to do something else

private schools tens of thousands of

dollars a year you've got four children

five children at a private school

or worse yet couples decide not to have

children because they can't pay no this

is not good

you think there will be an increased

movement in that direction after

three million people see this show

and learn that homeschooling is far more

not only far easier than you imagine it

but far more rewarding one of the

greatest gifts of many gifts that susan

lapin gave me

was

staying home

and educating seven children

from start to finish

some of our girls went to basiacov for

10th and 11th and 12th grade

some didn't

but everyone everyone home schooled and

uh our children thank god are doing just

fine i i really i'm i'm speaking very

seriously

as a as a jewish person you can

substantially cut down right i don't

want you to cut down on chon for shabbos

i don't want you to cut down on wine for

kiddish

but

it's time to reevaluate

do you really need

an expensive event for a for a happy

occasion for a simra

do you really have to pay private school

tuition no and very often mothers work

and you say why are you working what

happened to kavoda bas malefinema what

happened to the biblical verse that says

the honor of a princess is in the home

what happened to that no we're sending

her to commute for an hour to work every

day and then to work in a working round

there and she'll say very often well we

gotta i have to help cover tuition

very often

lady

what you're making isn't a whole lot

more than the tuition in the first place

quit work you're it's a wash right there

and now home school

and the values and the qualities and the

sheer magic this brings to your family

is unimaginable i i've lived it and

experienced it

you mentioned earlier

ads in jewish magazines it's something i

mentioned to my wife recently in that

maybe it's a form of assimilation but

these lavish jewelry ads and meat boards

and an expensive property property of

the seas right you know

why manage your second or third home

yourself when you can have a management

team do that and i'm thinking to myself

many people can't afford their first

home and b what message are we giving to

them there should be some sort of some

level of responsibility on the orthodox

jewish publication

to look at the ads and say what

pressures are we putting on people

that are flipping through this magazine

and subconsciously telling themselves

either what am i doing wrong or hey i

have to tell my wife we need to purchase

a b and c because apparently that's what

orthodox jews do these days yeah

i don't entirely agree with you because

i think

that um uh community sanctions and

pressure from above has to be used very

sparingly whether it is governmental

uh or whether it's communal and so i

would be reluctant

as a community to say well

uh i'm part of an association of rabbis

and hello mr magazine we're here to tell

you cut out those advertising i wouldn't

want to do that um they've got to pay

their bills and advertisers of of luxury

goods pay

pay for advertisements i have a right as

a homeowner i can decide whether to have

that magazine in my home or not

and if i feel that my family is going to

be made unhappy by the lavish

demonstration of of luxury goods then

there's lots of things i don't allow in

my home

and there would be another one

alternatively i might say look i i'm

raising my children to to have a mature

understanding of money and a realistic

understanding of money we do not believe

in equality we believe in freedom and

some people are going to have more some

people are going to have less we don't

even actually have a simple definition

of rich and poor it's always comparative

so

you know

thank god that there are people in the

jewish community that can afford those

things that's beautiful and that's

wonderful and you know what my blessing

for you

is that one of your five fs is finance

you should one day be able to have one

of those as well right now in order for

that to happen you need to go to the

next room where mother is getting ready

to start today's homeschool class

in economics and finance

so so yeah i mean i think uh i i do see

that but but i'm loath to say in the

same way with weddings by the way i

along with with some other rabbis rabbi

howard who i think you've spoken with

who i admire greatly um uh has said and

and he's absolutely right we don't want

to tell people

that you're not allowed to make a big

wedding god blessed you with the ability

god bless it that's wonderful enjoy it

people have to be able to be mature

about it and people have to have an

understanding of they have to fight

against the very understandable

human tendency of jealousy and envy and

and we make ourselves better people

yeah he he did say even these takanos or

or societal pressures and rules they

don't even work anyway so yes but yeah

this idea of being kazakh via mats being

strong and courageous yes it's not

natural it's not a default you've got to

work at it right got to raise courageous

children so when you're flipping through

those ads you're not

distracted i'm happy i look at them and

i say

what a beautiful time in history to be

living

when the the dominant financial

characteristic of jews is not abject

poverty and destitution but um the

question the question of what what

vacation home in jerusalem to buy

that's good

thank god it's wonderful so on that note

if someone was to hand you 10 million

dollars a hundred million dollars

a surprise great uncle passes away they

knock on your door

who is it rabbi lapin

we have a hundred million dollars in

your name how would you like to spend it

what would be your response to to that

question

um

well ellie

it is surprisingly difficult

to give money away without causing more

more harm than help

people don't always realize that but if

you're not sure just look at the life

history of uh

lottery winners who suddenly get

10 million dollars and and you see lives

almost invariably that have deteriorated

and are unrecognizably miserable um it

is very very difficult

to give large sums of money or for that

many even smaller sums of money away

without causing harm rather than help

very very hard

and so

if if the if the challenge was how would

i help the most number of people

um in the most meaningful way with 10

million dollars

uh i think i would probably start a

company

and

i would try to hire the people i want to

help who need good jobs

and i would try and

buy

my

supplies and needs from vendors who i i

want to help basically through the power

of business as opposed to just giving

and and we know in fact do we not that

in the hierarchy of

helping people

set up in business and becoming

independent is far far better than the

governmental model of turning them into

permanent dependence

is there a lesson there for

wealthy people when it comes to

transitional wealth they're handing it

down to

a newly married couple and

they have the ability to pay all their

bills is there a message there for that

person to do it in a way that is

constructive rather than destructive

yeah the problem is you know when is the

right time to start educating your child

how at what age should you start

when do you start educating your

children

when the child is three

four two

how about birth

well actually you're nine months late

already you're gonna have to race to

catch up that's why god gives us nine

months

to seriously get ready

and part of that

is to sit down with one's spouse

and figure out what the

the pattern of education is going to be

number one number two

certain principles hugely important

um husband and wife

father and mother never disagree in

front of the child

i'm not saying susan and i have never

disagreed we've had arguments that we've

had to take to my father to settle

but

i once checked with our children not all

of them i checked with someone else did

you ever see us

ever ever hear or see us arguing with

each other no

and and so i think we did that part

right amidst many many many mistakes

uh but we did that part right and it's

scary and unsettling for a child to see

it's not good yeah it's not and it's not

good for the marriage because taking

sides all together it's just plain bad

news

so um

in the same way to start educating

your your child to be able to take over

assets because again inheritance is not

again a natural thing in the world of

socialism

um the ideal death tax is a hundred

percent they don't want you to be able

to pass on anything to your child as

opposed to all the other children of

society and government will be your

convenient happy pay master no the torah

decrees exactly what should happen to a

person's assets when they pass on to

hashem

and the it has to go to children the

trouble is that it's far too late to

start educating children what to do with

wealth at that point

and don't think that if you send your

child to your shiver the child's going

to learn that he's not it's your

responsibility especially if you're

homeschooling right well then there's no

question about it that's right

so

and a lot of that comes you know you

asked earlier about um

what to do

to increase you know let's say you

decide you you you know

short term i've got to cut expense i got

to use my courage and take away expenses

that i that i don't really need but i do

for social reasons and convention

but

increasing revenues is the longer term

solution to inflation and it's it's

hugely important multiple streams of

revenue are very very important how do

you do it what are you supposed to do

uh well you know there are

there are so many guys in lakewood that

have learned to be amazon resellers that

amazon is actually aware of them as a

group

and and that's a wonderful thing there

are guys there that realized that here

is a way of of using technology

to be able to support their families

it's beautiful as well there are always

things like that but the first key is

something we spoke about a little bit

earlier which is connection

the book of ruth good time of the year

to be thinking about it um speak to

people

you know there's a reason why so many

jewish names were trade names it wasn't

an accident

right um

one of the uh the great business uh

advisors was the late peter drucker

drucker he's a

a printer in german and yiddish

it's like walking around with a great

big business card or or a billboard

pasted to your forehead

hi you know my name is um is uh gold

goldsmith goldberg silversmith silverman

whatever you are oh you know what i need

to buy some jewelry for my son's new

bride

because custom says i have to and and so

can i come and see yeah that's great we

just met

you've got to talk to people you've got

to meet there and you've got to say

i'm thinking of

looking for new opportunities

do you have any advice and you'll find

connections start happening so that's

very important number two is

understand the power of the shooter foot

the understand the partner the idea of a

partnership

um again

very very important you know in in the

talmudic structure as we move our way

through from baba kama and bob matsia

and bhava basra

where we find that we're actually giving

ourselves an education i wish this was

taught properly in yeshiva

when i i i give shurim to young guys and

and they know the mercedes but what's

the reason these are in order like you

know why don't we have sohim a absurd b

what's going on here it's really

important right

you've got to understand that hashem is

giving us a a pattern for the

development of

economic interaction

and so the commerce starts off with

alvos naziken damages ways that human

beings can inadvertently and sometimes

deliberately hurt one another that's the

initial stage of human cooperation we

don't know each other we're just

starting

we can hurt each other okay let's let's

get that part right okay terrific then

we come to batman see and now we talk

about hey we're friends everything's

good hey friends can have disagreements

too schneider i'm obviously but two of

us can say hey way to say you know this

is my no i think this is mine i sold it

to you on this day not on that day

good and then finally

bob us now we're talking partnerships

the power of partnership is embedded in

a jewish world view

and

we don't do ourselves a service

by fixing our car on sunday afternoon

and doing our income taxes on monday

night and tuesday night and wednesday

night and

mowing the lawn on thursday no

there are lawn mowing companies hire

them they are tax companies use them

there are motor mechanics use them

because if you try and do everything for

yourself you're violating the principle

of the broker of our grace after meals

where we thank god for creating lots of

human beings the gesture none

and their needs

well

if nobody else had any needs i'd starve

to death the only way i eat is because i

supply other people's needs

how do you square the two of cutting

expenses but yet hiring

the gardener

uh and you're right it's short-term

longer-term right if you're if you're

literally

having trouble uh with finding out that

the month lost longer than your your in

your your budget uh yeah then you have

to cut wherever you can but the goal is

to reach a point where what you do is

much more valuable

if i help somebody write a business plan

in the two hours it would have taken me

to mow the lawn i'd be crazy

because i get paid far far far more than

the 30 dollars i pay the teenager down

the road who mows my lawn for me

so

these are important principles finding a

partner seeing if

you find somebody not as somebody who

you like and get on with and agree with

everything because you need somebody

who is

a male and female to you in the sense

that

creativity and productivity only comes

from people with different abilities so

if i'm a good inside person i love

sitting in the workshop making widgets

on a

on a machine tool

but i'm i haven't effective idea of how

to reach the people who actually need

widgets well then i'm going to look for

a partner

and if i'm a really good talker and i

i'm i'm really good at

selling and communicating with people

all i got to do is find that lonely

widget manufacturer who's scratching his

head figuring he's there

you just have to talk to enough people

you'll find him

in the times of our forefathers people

regularly lived hundreds of years right

mr shellach well over 900 years as the

average age of people increase it's not

crazy to think that the world's slowly

progressing

where the average age will be over 100

years old soon so do you think people

are working later in life because

longevity is is a real

factor in all of this people are living

longer and

if someone told you robbie lapin

[Music]

we've come a long way in in aging cures

and things of that nature

you're going to be living to 250 years

old

what would you do in the short term and

what would you do in the long term

loaded question

yeah

so

um

you know the the truth is that it's much

much better

um for society for people to live longer

than shorter in the same way that it's

also better for society for people to

have what to lose

believe me i would be terrified to live

in a neighborhood where all the other

people in my neighborhood feel they've

got nothing to lose

because they got nothing to lose they

will behave recklessly

maybe dangerously maybe criminally

i want to live among people who have a

lot to lose

and i want to live among people who

think long term not short term

so let me answer your question by

looking at the corollary of that for

just a moment and that is

what do you do if god forbid the doctor

tells him that um he's got three days to

live you know what he does

first of all draws up a list

like the lord high executioner in um

in the mikado the gilbert and sullivan

operator i've got a little list i draw

up a list of all the people i'm really

mad at all my enemies and then i take

the 357 magnum and i do away they're

like what are they going to do like

execute me

so i'll take care of them and then a few

other items of business i'll take care

of as well so it's really not good for

people to have a short-term

vision of the future really not good

and in fact i mean just a lot of some of

the awful things that happen in society

is because people don't see themselves

as having much of a future

um

conversely now

i'm going to live for hundreds and

hundreds of years this is great as the

talmud tells us first thing i'm going to

do is plant an orchard

because i'm going to get to enjoy the

fruit even if it takes 70 years

that's good

i'm going to do some long-term

investments i'm going to buy land

outside of of the town because over the

next 100 or 200 years the town is going

to spread in that direction i'm pretty

sure it's going to go in that direction

not in that direction so i'm going to

get into the land development business

that's good for everybody and so on and

so forth so one of the great gifts of

children is that they make us live

forever they see a and that's the whole

idea of the torah view of of um

inheritance and so on um you know our

lives will be very different if the law

did not allow us to leave anything to

our children okay fine you've just

you've robbed me of a large part of my

motivation

so uh children give us immortality and

immortality is a good thing after all

it's only the uh the that little

snafu

in the garden of eden that brought death

into the world so if we can defeat it

through the immortality that children

bring us that's one of the great gifts

of fertility and and it's a beautiful

thing that of the industrialized

countries of the west israel is way

ahead in fertility

israel has a fertility rate and and and

it's everybody it's it's it's a

beautiful thing it's the only place in

the world i've traveled where you know

you waited a light to cross a busy

intersection and i'm just standing there

and some kid comes along and i've never

seen this kid before sticks a grubby

hand in my hand holds onto my hand when

the light turns green and holds my hand

walking we get to the other side kid

leaves go and run so his mom told him

you gotta hold an adult's hand when you

cross the street

you know that's israel um the fertility

rate in the united states of america is

now below replacement

a financial disaster for the long term

so yeah no children grant one the the

the virtual impact

of living for hundreds of years

i want to end with this um this thought

because you you see

many righteous people

living in poverty they're following the

ways of the torah and

we know that there's a bigger picture

this world's just hallway and this is

temporary but

how do you

view saintly people living in poverty is

there something

bigger at play

tell us about that

um

it's always painful

it's always hard

we don't like to see anybody suffer

and particularly

we see that person as uh as an example

you know gosh the the life that that he

or she or they are living um when i say

that i don't mean a vague pronoun i mean

the family

they uh

it was so lovely if god could bless them

with wealth

i want to give an analogy

imagine

the same

sadiq

the same righteous person the same

saintly person

goes up onto the roof

of a 50-story building

and he jumps off

and after an initially thrilling ride he

comes to a very sudden stop

that ends his time on this earth

and he comes before our creator

and

he's got a really indignant look on his

heavenly face

and god says to like excuse me

what are you looking like that for

he says how could you do this to me what

did i do

well you didn't rescue me you did

nothing to help me

are you talking about well i'm telling

you

i came off the top of the building

you had a good

four five six seconds to swoop in there

and lower me gently to the ground you're

god

but you didn't do it

and ah kurdish boroku's answer is very

simple

i put you on this earth

to get to know it

right one of the ways that you get to

know

any artist is by looking at his work

right

you want to know me

that's how that's why the ram starts the

the mishna torah with the idea of it's

you have to know not believe you've got

to know the only way you know is by

studying the world so you get to know

the creator

there's a reason why the overwhelming

majority of scientific advances of the

last four centuries

up until the the 20th were done by bible

believing christians

because the bible is a clue to the unity

of creation and therefore it makes

perfect sense to look for an explanation

for gravity or an explanation for

electrostatic attraction and to not be

that shocked when the formula

arrangement of these two separate and

distinct forces look identical and yeah

why shouldn't they yeah

so you're supposed to get to know this

earth one of the things you should know

is a thing called gravity

and that means i don't have to tell you

about that i don't tell jews make sure

you breathe regularly i leave that to

you

i don't say jews make sure you eat three

meals a day i leave that to you

i don't tell you watch out for gravity

i leave that to you you should have done

that

finance and economics fall into the same

category

which is why

there is a uh a tradition

all the way the vilna gone was big on

this there's a strong tradition to study

economics

to understand money because it's very

difficult to understand the foundations

of a quarter of the code of jewish law

if you don't actually understand the

nature of what money is how does it work

so it's a very important thing

and so

um the same thing

applies we we say to this guy hey

i'm really sorry that you lived in

poverty and i do accept that there but

there's you know bad luck things happen

and maybe that was maybe that was your

situation in which case i apologize and

if there's any way i can help you i'd

like to help you

but for many many many people

it's because they operate on the basis

that all i've got to do is be exotic all

i have to do is be righteous

and a college broker who will will send

me everything i need and furthermore

misunderstandings over simplifications

of complex mishnis you know on this day

god decides

your what your income for the year is

going to be

okay i get that so therefore i may as

well sit back

go to florida relax

no that's not how it works

you're trivializing a very deep and

profound topic that better people than

us have poured over for centuries to get

a full understanding of so it's easy to

fall into that trap and and by the way

the secular world does it as well with

books like the secret and things like

that the law of attraction oh you just

got to will these things and the ferrari

will come to you no that's not actually

how the world really works

you have to deliver something to the

world as well that's what god wants

and so

we have to say to this person

uh yeah god set up a wonderful world

where he actually incentivized you to do

what he wants you to do he wants you to

be obsessively preoccupied with the

needs and desires of all his other

children

and if you do that

you call you get something called pay or

salary or profit or wages that's how it

works

and so it's it's not something fully and

clearly understood

does does god want me to be rich

i have no idea

he doesn't tell me everything

i don't know

but i do know

that he does want me to be obsessively

preoccupied

with trying to fill the needs of other

people

and when i do that

and i am showered with abundance it

doesn't surprise me

a good and loving hashem is of course

that's what he does

but you've got to do your part in your

part the fact that you are uh that you

pray three times a day shakris min

kamarev in the synagogue

very important i you gotta do that

but that's the start not the end

learning torah absolutely

can't not do that time with torah can i

yeah you've got to learn

but that's the start that's not all

there is

you always have to make a living

you have to have a wife you have to have

children you have to let them live you

got to be able to give something of

significance to other people

that means making some money

and so overcoming

overcoming the embarrassment

of making money is one of the biggest

obstacles facing um some of the people

i'm helping

move on from call

because both them and their wives are

embarrassed

that they're no longer in learning

very difficult to deal with again

courage insight and a love of truth

become hugely important

and just to crystallize this

the idea that sadiq righteous people

or some righteous people do not have

large loads of money it's not to say

that they're not giving back or helping

others

it could be that their

financial success is not their focus

that's not what they clearly are not

they're not striving for that right

absolutely but um

there's a difference yeah no question

about it uh would many people who are

focused on

spiritual areas would they do better if

they would divert some of their energy

and attention to what is needed to make

a living no question

they're not going to become you know

elon musk they don't have to but they

will certainly make a living absolutely

that that is is very important um but

but yes the uh

the the idea is

that again it's the integrating the

totality the holistic aspect of it um

i i believe and i and i think i can

prove it from torah sources

that

that the person who actually has a few

dollars and doesn't have worry on his

head financially um has a better

spiritual connection and

a more foundational spiritual reality

than um than somebody who does and

and you know there's some lovely jewish

families like i said i was i was at a

family wedding not not my family

somebody else's but it was a lovely

family it was uh they had friends they

had tremendous emphasis on family they

have fortune their finances and i

thought what a what a beautiful model of

a family

they study they learn they they relate

to god

and they have they they help a lot of

people and they got family it there is a

totality and uh i'm not a better person

than you because i spurn

the uh horrors of money and devote

myself entirely to the base of medicine

nothing else that doesn't make me a

better person than you
