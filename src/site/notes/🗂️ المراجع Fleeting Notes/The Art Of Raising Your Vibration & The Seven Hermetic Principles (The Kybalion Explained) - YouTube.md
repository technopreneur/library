The 7 Hermetic Principles of The Kybalion summarized and explained. 

This is not just a theory or a philosophy - the principles, being universal, are down-to-earth practical. If you apply them consciously in your life, your life will change. While in times long gone by, these may have seemed to be only arbitrary spiritual principles, they are in accord with the view of quantum physics. Kybalion states that universe is mind-like in nature; quantum physics states that the universe is composed out of intelligent energy. The most important part of this book - other than pointing out these principles is that they are UNIVERSAL - they always work, they express throughout nature and if you use them and apply the consciously, you can create whatever you can possibly desire in your life. You will know then that there is a law and that it works with mathematical precision, and that you can ALWAYS count on it. The moment you grasp this truth, you will never ever again wish or hope for something to happen, you will know that you have the power to create it and you will be certain of it. And when you use this principles consciously and experience the truth of them - no one in the entire world will ever be able to talk you out of fulfilling your heart's desires. Even if the entire world doubts and laughs at you, you will not care because you'll KNOW that you CAN. You will have the "key". "The Kybalion: A Study of The Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece" By Three Initiates 


=================================== 
<!--SR:!2023-09-18,1,230-->

this is Julian and I'm here in Berlin

Germany and this week's book is the

cabal Ian a study of the hermetic

philosophy of ancient Egypt and Greece

and this book was actually anonymously

published under the pseudonym the three

initiate and straight up it's a little

[ __ ] out there okay I thought I'd

switch things up a bit and introduce a

book that's one of the spiritual side of

things and you know it's a little woowoo

okay it's not the easiest read but

absolutely loved it okay there's a lot

to take from it and the whole philosophy

really rests upon these seven principles

okay and what I thought I'd do in this

video is list them explain them and

you're gonna [ __ ] love it

so the first principle is the principle

of mentalism okay and this one here is

the basic principle of the whole

hermetic philosophy and that is that the

all is mind the universe is mental okay

now what does that mean the all okay the

way that it's defined here is the

substantial reality underlying all the

outward manifestations in appearances

which we know as the material universe

the phenomena of life matter energy so

on and so forth okay there's the saying

under and back of the universe of time

space and change is ever to be found the

substantial reality the fundamental

truth the all okay so basically if you

look around you get the material

universe everything you see everything

that is people objects energy matter so

on and so forth

you probably noticed okay nothing is

permanent okay everything's in a

constant state of changing and becoming

okay things are created things are born

things grow things decay things die

things disappear so on and so forth and

what it says here is that all of these

changing things okay everything that is

including yourself must be some kind of

outward appearances or manifestations of

some underlying power some substantial

reality and the name that they give the

substantial reality here is

the all ok it is self-evident it needs

no argument okay you can compare it to

yourself okay assuming you're into

spirituality

you probably meditated before and what

did you notice

okay there are your thoughts there's a

little voice inside your head there are

your mental images mental creations your

imagination different ideas okay but

what is there also the being from which

those ideas emerge okay and you can

actually take perspective you can

observe them okay that's a lot of

meditation you just sit there you try to

quiet your mind and if idea pops up or

some little voice you know engine starts

okay what about this what about this

what about this you can actually be the

observer okay you're a go there's that

little voice okay in that little voice

what is it it's some kind of outward

appearance or manifestation of your

being

okay of the observer okay and it's the

same here with the universe okay

basically everything that is right now

everything that's changing everything

that exists is simply outward

appearances or manifestations okay in

this case not of your being but of the

all okay which is infinite instead of

our being which is just finite okay that

there is the basic understanding of it

all and the reason okay it's mental okay

the universe is mental is because okay

what they say about the all here is one

the all must be all that really is there

can be nothing outside of the all else

the all would not be the all okay that's

the first thing to understand the second

one is that the all must be infinite

okay and this is key they all must be

infinite for there's nothing else to

define confine bound limit or restrict V

all it must be infinite in time or

eternal I must have always continuously

existed for there is nothing else to

have ever created it and something can

never evolve from nothing and if it have

ever not been even for a moment

it would not be now it must continuously

exist forever for there's nothing to

destroy it and it can never

not be even for a moment because

something can never become nothing okay

it is infinite in space it must be

everywhere for there is no place outside

of the all and it cannot be otherwise

then continuous in space without break

separation or interruption for there's

nothing to break separate or interrupt

its continuity and nothing with which to

fill in the gaps

okay must be infinite in power or

absolute for there is nothing to limit

restrict restrain confine

disturb or condition it it is subject to

no other power for there is no other

power okay that's the second one and the

third one is the all must be immutable

or not subject to change in its real

nature okay for there's nothing to work

change upon it nothing into which it

could change nor from which it could

have changed it cannot be added to or

subtracted from okay this is huge

increased or diminished nor become

greater or lesser in any respect

whatsoever

it must have always been and must always

remain just what it is now the all okay

then there has never been is not now and

will never be anything else into which

it can change

okay now understanding this okay and

this is why the universe is mental how

does the all create the universe okay

the universe again is changing things

are being created things are growing but

they all can't because it's already part

of the all okay so how can they all

create because if it creates something

in a way it's creating something that

it's not and the all is everything okay

it's also in a way separating from it

and they cannot be subtracted from or

added to so how does it create mentally

that's the only way that the all can

create wall okay abiding these three

things so the universe is mental okay

held in the mind of the all okay and

that's really the way to view everything

okay it's like the infinite mind of the

all is the womb of the universes

okay all is mind

and to take this a little further to

what it says here is that there's also

the all-in-all okay so for example when

you're you know comparing it to us

against a meditation and the being and

the different thoughts images so on and

so forth when you're thinking of

something like let's just say you

imagine some sort of story with

different characters okay

from the characters perspective okay

it's like they're just the character

okay but in a way they're also part of

the all from which it's emerging but

they're not the all okay it's a matter

of perspective

okay the character cannot be the all

because the all is everything but there

is the all in the character because it's

an outward manifestation of the all okay

that makes sense so there is the all in

all of us and building on this - okay

talks about mental transmutation and

this is huge okay in the hermetic

philosophy and that is that mind as well

as metals and elements may be transmuted

from state to state degree 2 degree

condition to condition pole to pole

vibration to vibration okay true

hermetic transmutation is a mental art

okay and what that basically means is

that if the universe is mental in nature

then this is the art of changing the

conditions of universe along the lines

of mental force and mind the second

principle is the principle of

Correspondence okay and that is as above

so below as below so above okay

basically there is always a

correspondence between the laws and

phenomena of the various planes of being

and life okay all of these seven

hermetic principles are in full

operation on all of the mini planes and

this here is a truth because all that is

included in the universe emanates from

the same source okay and this one here

understanding this principle allows you

to solve

you know many paradoxes or even you know

hidden secrets of nature and we actually

apply this principle funny enough in the

first principle okay will be compared

the all in the universe

to us our being and then our finite

mental universe of thoughts ideas so on

and so forth okay here was the same

principle as above so below as below so

above okay this is what allowed us to

find out that there is an all okay that

there is this underlying power okay and

what they say here too in terms of the

various planes is that the universe may

be divided into three classes of

phenomena the three Great Plains and all

are held in the mind of the all okay and

at the bottom there's the great physical

plane above that there's the great

mental plane and above that there's the

great spiritual plane okay and as a

little sigh no to these divisions are

more or less artificial and arbitrary

okay there's not any real divisions like

here's the physical plane so on and so

forth all these plans can be you know

planes can be divided into sub planes so

on and so forth and they pretty much

just melt into each other okay it's like

different shades of a color

there's no point where there's like this

distinct separation okay this is more so

just in terms of understanding the

concept and what it says here too is

that the higher the degree of rate of

vibration okay and we'll talk about this

in the next principle where everything

vibrates but basically the higher okay

the degree of rate of vibration the

higher the plane and the higher the

manifestation of life occupying that

plane

okay so low vibration okay the lowest

one is like this gross form of matter

okay in the physical plane and as you

rise okay in terms of your vibration you

go from physical to mental to spiritual

and it talks about here how that there

okay is like your purpose it's to keep

rising your vibration until you go up to

the spiritual to the point where at the

end okay there's only this thin little

deal between you and the all and then at

some point you know you become one with

you all okay so that's the second

principle the third principle is the

principle of vibration okay and that is

that nothing rests everything moves

everything vibrates

okay and this here basically

everything's in motion everything around

you these are facts that's modern

science endorses okay and the

differences between different

manifestations of matter energy mind and

even spirits result largely from varying

rates of vibration okay and this is huge

okay so all is in vibration including

your thoughts can your emotions mental

states they all have their corresponding

rate and mode of vibration okay and the

lower the vibration it's like that's

what you want to ideally stay away from

so let's just say you're angry you're

scared

okay just emotions those have lower

rates of vibration and as you raise your

vibration you can go from say angry to

happy you can go from fearful to feeling

courageous okay so on and so forth and

this here okay enables the Hermetic

students to control their own mental

vibrations as well of those of others

okay this is kind of where mental

transmutation comes into play or let's

just say you're you're scared you're

like oh my god I'm so scared

okay you can actually Zone in on the

level or degree of vibration and you can

rise okay you can just like raise the

vibrations and then change okay like

transmute that feeling to feeling sick

or ages the fourth principle is the

principle of polarity okay and that is

that everything is dual everything has

poles everything has its pair of

opposites like and unlike are the same

opposites are identical in nature but

different in degree extremes meet all

truths are but half truths all paradoxes

can be reconciled okay what this

basically means is that all things

manifested have two sides okay two poles

and the difference okay between things

for example that seem drastically

opposed to each other is merely a matter

of degree okay they are identical in

nature but different in degree okay so

for example let's just take hot and cold

okay two poles let's just say it's like

extremely hot and

to me cold okay but in reality it's the

same thing okay

hot cold it's the same thing except okay

it's varying degrees of the same thing

okay there's you know different degrees

as you go up from cold to hot okay the

same with light and darkness there's

varying degrees between the two poles

large small hard soft black white sharp

dull noise quiet high low positive

negative so on and so forth okay and the

important thing to understand here with

the principle of polarity is that this

also applies on the mental plane okay if

you take love and hate for example there

are not different things they are the

same thing okay but different degree

okay you know the degrees of hate and

love with the middle point of like or

dislike okay and once again these shade

into each other so gradually that

sometimes you know we're at a loss to

even know if it's like liked or disliked

okay the same with good and evil and

this here once again linking it back to

mental transmutation okay if you change

the vibration okay the way it works is

you're just going from one pole to

another pole okay you can rise or lower

your vibration at will changing your

polarity okay and you can go for example

from love to hate or you can go from

hate to love okay and this works because

it's the same class okay if it's a

different class you can't okay if you're

like scared you can't go to love okay

you can go to courage but not love it

has to be the same class the same kind

of thing but just varying degrees okay

with the vibration you can change the

degrees okay this is the fourth

principle the fifth one is the principle

of rhythm okay and that is that

everything flows out and in everything

has its tides all things rise and fall

the pendulum swing manifests in

everything the measure of the swing to

the right is the measure of the swing to

the left rhythm comp

sates okay so what does this mean you

know if you take both poles okay have

you know anything there is a rhythm the

manifests between the two poles

established by the principle of polarity

okay

there is always an action in a reaction

an advance retreat

rising in a sinking expansion

contraction okay so if you take for

example a moment of happiness okay it's

like you swing up the pole you feel

extremely happy but most likely what

follows okay in a way a moment of

sadness okay at some point it goes down

okay what goes up must come down

and this applies to everything you know

if you take on a universe or star it

expands and it shrinks okay something is

born it grows and then it decays and

dies okay there is a certain rhythm that

happens okay and this manifests in

everything be a universe sons Worlds men

mind energy matter

there's night and day okay the swing

between the two summer winter creation

and destruction rise and fall different

mental states you know success as we

mentioned before like successions of

moods feelings

okay enthusiasm can be followed by

depression courage succeeded by equal

moods of fear okay and there is no such

thing as absolute rest okay the

universal pendulum is ever in motion

okay there is always the rhythmic swing

from one pole to another okay now with

this ok understanding this you know

people who study their hermetic

philosophy there is such a thing it

called the law of neutralization okay

where they're able to escape this ok

instead of just being rocked and you're

just like oh my god I'm going from this

state to this state to this state to

this state basically what it says is

that there are two general planes of

consciousness the lower and the higher

and the understanding of which enables

you to rise to a higher plane and escape

the swing ok

rhythmic pendulum which manifests on the

lower plane okay so you can actually

polarize yourself

okay rise in vibration and then actually

have control okay you go to a higher

plane where the swing okay it operates

at the lower one it just kind of goes

under you okay and what's under

important to understand here too is that

you can't annul this okay all these

principles exist whether you like them

or not so it's still going to happen

there's still such a thing as this sling

but okay instead of annulling it you can

escape its effects okay and you can

learn how to use it for examples that

have been used by it the next one is the

principle of cause and effect okay and

what does that mean every cause has its

effect every effect has its cause

everything happens according to law

chance is but a name for law not

recognized

there are many planes of causation but

nothing escapes the law okay so what

does that mean everything happens to law

okay nothing happens by chance okay

chances again merely an expression

relating to obscure causes okay causes

that we cannot perceive causes that we

cannot understand uh but nothing ever

happens without a cause or a chain of

causes okay so even if you take luck

like say you're throwing a dice okay

whatever number pops up you may think

you know what that's a luck but in

reality it's not okay

it's a cause or chain of causes okay so

for example it could be the position of

the dice can when you pick it up the

amounts of muscular energy you know

expanded expended in the [ __ ] throw

the conditions of the table so on and so

forth and those linked back to other

causes and other causes and other causes

may be the mental state you're in how

tired you are which affects the energy

maybe something happened to the table

before there's all these different

causes there is no such thing as chance

okay

and here it's very important okay

there's a relation existing between

everything that has gone before and

everything that follows no event creates

another event okay but is merely instead

a preceding link and the great orderly

chain of events flowing from the Curie

creative energy from the all okay so

everything is a chain of events you

change something way way way like years

ago it's going to affect everything

sometimes do huge degrees what it says

here is that the majority of people

manifest very little freedom you know we

think we have free will but in reality

were slaves to our environments

you know the opinions of people

different customs different thoughts

different emotions feelings moods so on

and so forth you know you may tell you

tell yourself I do what I want to do you

know I do as I please but we have to ask

yourself here is what makes the want to

arise you know what makes the as I

please arise okay and there's always a

because okay something affects you

there's a cause and that's why you do it

okay you don't really have free will and

here okay it's like the master okay the

student of hermetic philosophy can

change these pleases and once basically

uh by will okay by mental will he's able

to will to will instead of to will

because of some feeling moody motion or

environmental suggestion and he does

this by rising to a higher plane okay so

everything kind of goes hand in hand

it's like you rise in vibration you rise

to a higher plane okay where you're able

to dominate your own mood okay you

change the vibration you change your

mood and you're the one who is having

direct control versus something or

someone else okay and this is very

important if you don't proactively

consciously do this you are going to be

reacting you will not have any free will

and by doing this okay instead of being

a pond you become a mover okay and as I

mentioned with the previous principle

you can't get rid of this principle okay

it's going to happen no matter what

there's always cause and effect but you

can again go to that higher plane and

help rule on the lower plane instead of

being ruled down there okay and the last

principle here is the principle of

gender and that is that gender is in

everything everything has its masculine

and feminine principles gender men

on all planes okay and when you hear

gender okay it doesn't necessarily mean

sex okay in a way sex is just a

manifestation of gender on the physical

plane but gender would it refers to here

is to procreate to generate to create to

produce okay it's a lot more of a broad

term and there is gender manifested in

everything okay everything and every

person contains the two elements within

it him or her and the way it works here

okay is that the masculine principle K

oftentimes associated with the positive

principle if you take for example a

magnet there's positive negative okay

different polarity the masculine

principle directs a certain inherent

energy toward the feminine principle and

thus starting the activity of the

creative process okay that's the

masculine principle and the feminine

principle is always the one doing the

active creative work okay on all planes

but each principle is incapable of

operative energy without the assistance

of the other okay and this is very

interesting and from this comes the dual

mind idea okay where there's the

masculine principle of mind for example

the objective mind the voluntary mind

the active mind and then there's the

feminine principle of mind and that is

the subjective mind the unconscious mind

the involuntary mind the passive mind

okay masculine let's just say conscious

mind feminine subconscious mind and when

you think I am okay this in reality can

be split into two parts okay two aspects

and both aspects are working in unison

okay although they're separated okay

there's masculine the feminine okay

there's the gender there exists an i and

a me okay and the me is usually mistaken

for the AI okay so what does that mean

as a person you know when you think of

yourself on a lower level we think that

we're composed of certain things

feelings tastes likes dislikes habits

characteristics our body or physical

appearance sometimes even our [ __ ]

clothes okay that's like the lower level

like this is me okay

all this is me and as you rise okay on a

higher plane

you started this identifying with that

okay like all these external physical

things and in the middle you know you're

left with say different thoughts

different emotions you think that is you

but then you rise okay above that and

you're more than just different mental

states emotions feelings qualities or

characteristics okay and at the top okay

it's like me becomes a something mental

in which thoughts ideas emotions

feelings may be produced okay and we can

link this once again with the principle

of correspondence to the all okay

remember it's like the all is like the

womb in which the universe is created if

you will and which everything is

manifested the me okay is what I talked

about before in terms of the being let's

just say okay here it's like the me the

me is the mental womb capable of

generating mental offspring okay however

what you also find is that there also

exists a mental something which is able

to will that the me act along certain

creative lines and which is also and

which is also able to stand aside and

witness the mental creation okay the I

so there's the me which is the womb and

then the I okay the masculine principle

if you will with will can projects or an

energy so that different things are

created let's just say in different ways

and can witness it okay so it goes a

little deep here but there are those two

aspects and once again the I is the

masculine principle the aspect of being

the me is the feminine principle the

aspect of becoming okay and if you're

too lazy to act if you're too lazy to

take conscious control to exert that

will okay let's just say to rise in

vibration for example someone else will

do it for you okay and what it says here

is that too few people have original

thoughts or original actions that are

performed they're just mere shadows and

echoes of others with stronger will okay

and masters of the Hermetic teaching

dominate their own minds by their

we'll and the minds of others so these

here are these seven hermetic principles

to know more about them check the

[ __ ] book out but I absolutely loved

it okay in this way of thinking

especially in terms of raising your

vibration is something that's been on my

mind for quite some time okay especially

after this year's chain of events I made

a video to with Owen okay I'd recommend

checking out I'll put a little link here

below on progression versus degeneration

get on that and be sure to check the

comments here below for next week's book

until next time
