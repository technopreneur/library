**Title: Viktor Frankl: Self-Actualization is not the goal - YouTube**

- Viktor Frankl references Nietzsche's line, "he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how." This emphasizes the importance of meaning for survival.
- The "will to meaning" is the fundamental motivation in human beings, surpassing the determinist notions that humans are products of instincts or machines.
- Logotherapy is a "meaning-centered" psychotherapy. It doesn't focus on the will to pleasure or power but on the will to meaning.
- European students report experiencing an "inner void" less than American students. Both groups should approach each other with compassion.
- The existence of an inner void or existential vacuum is evidence for the human will to meaning.
- Frankl lists three types of values:
  - **Creative Values**: Finding meaning through deeds and work.
  - **Experiential Values**: Finding meaning in experiences, like beauty or human interactions.
  - **Attitudinal Values**: Choosing one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, especially challenging ones.
- Even in terrible situations, like concentration camps, one can choose their attitude and find meaning.
- Death is the ultimate challenge in attitude choice. Frankl believes that the past isn't lost, but preserved forever. Everything we've done and experienced has lasting value.
- The past, both positive and negative, is a testament to our life's experiences and actions.

--------

in your work you you quote Nietzsche quite a bit his a line "he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how". What do you think he meant by that? What I think that..? What you think he meant by that? The same as I'm intended to convey to my readers and students: that the vision of a meaning ahead of someone, a meaning in wait for someone to be fulfilled by someone, that this contributes most than anything else under equal other circumstances for survival. Meaning is the most important

thing in our lives? Certainly because a what I call a "will to meaning" - the wish to find and to fulfill meaning is the basic motivation in human beings. This certainly runs counter to much of the determinist notions that are being bandied around these days that man is a machine man is a computer man is a product of instincts.

Man is something like a rat in experiments psychological experiments. Of course you are right but not only against the so called deterministic concepts of man but also regarding the motivational theories of certain psychotherapeutic systems. Let's talk for a minute about logotherapy which arose out of this notion of a search for meaning.

Logotherapy, as one among other types of psychotherapy, is we may say a "meaning centered" psychotherapy in as much particularly as logotherapy sees a human being not predominantly determined, not to say dominated by the will to pleasure as you were mentioning, nor by the will to power along the lines of Adlerian teachings, but basically fundamentally by a will to meaning.

That is to say the desire, the impulse to find to discover in life or better to say in each life situation, concrete life situation confronting someone, the desire to find a meaning therein and to go on to fulfill it. I was very intrigued one of the most surprising things I've read recently was that you said that when you talk to European students only 40 percent said they had suffered this sort of inner void and yet eighty-one percent of American students experience the same thing.

We think of it just the opposite, we think of the Europeans as being buried under this existential dread and sense of purposelessness and Americans is being optimistic and upbeat. However it might be, whether the ones or the others are suffering more or less respectively from this existential vacuum, the ones who seem to suffer less should not look at the others with contempt but look at the others with compassion and look for anything possible to help the others. Now this void manifests itself as in apathy

in boredom, lack of initiative, lack of interest - interest in the world or initiative in changing something within the world for the better. This frustration is a a proof of the existence of a will to meaning. Unless we were imbued by a will to meaning by the wish to find meaning and discuss discover and fulfill meaning in life we never would be able to experience an inner void so this is in a way also something positive.

Now you've listed three types of values creative values, experiential values and attitudinal variants. You may find a meaning the "average" man, the man on the street or the woman on the street may find a meaning day by day in doing a deed in creating a work and - that's the creative - creative and in experiencing something. The beauty.

The truth as a researcher, or the good in dealing with people as a teacher or whatsoever. There's an extraordinary moment in "man's search for meaning" when you talk about being in one of the one of the Nazi camps and all of you going out to look at a sunset. Is that experiential? Exactly this is a paradigm of experiential values, of finding a meaning in experiencing without doing anything without achieving or accomplishing anything but just in giving oneself the immediate experience of something say

beautiful going on in the world. This is the second avenue but there is also another aspect of experiential values. Excuse me, not only experiencing something but also experiencing someone. More than that, experiencing another human being in his or her very uniqueness and it is the main attribute of a human being that he is a person in contrast to any animal he is a person a person is always something absolutely unique irreparable in the evolution of the cosmos as is we are incomparable with any other human being

and this uniqueness can be got hold of solely by a loving person, Because he not only sees the essence but also the potentials in the beloved person thereby as I put it before promoting him alleviating it to reach out to attain this potential and to fulfill and thereby actualize also himself but not by preaching self-actualization.

It's nonsense self-actualization can only fall into your lap automatically once that you have fulfilled a concrete meaning, done the best of a situation. Then you actualize yourself as a by-product. Let's talk about the third set of values which is the attitudinal, the idea of choosing how to respond to suffering.

Choosing the attitude - yes. If there is no possibility in a given situation to fulfill the meaning of a situation by giving oneself to the experience of beauty and so forth. Nor if you have lost the capability to do your job to do your work even then there is an ultimate possibility to find and fulfill meaning - not only the ultimate it is even the potential to fulfill the deepest meaning, to attain the highest values: by your approach to the given situation, a tragic or trist situation confronting you. You said that in part of the initial shock of

being put in a death camp was there was was ultimately an acceptance that we knew we had nothing to lose except our ridiculously naked lives is that the situation that they're in? - In a way - Is this when you make the choice of how you go into.. your last value choices how to react to the situation? You stand there, you stood there naked with nothing you could have had but all the more what counted and the mattered was what you were - "being" rather than "having", possessing anything. So what

counted was what you make out of this situation, what attitude you adopt in the given situation and there is a multitude a wealth of possible attitudes to how to approach it. So we have to decide. The ultimate I would take it attitudinal value challenge that we all share is how we're going to face death.

How do you prepare people for that? How do you prepare yourself for that? I couldn't prepare anyone else unless I would have prepared myself because if you are a psychiatrist your patients feel exactly whether or not you are really convinced of what you are teaching and telling them. Now I'm convinced that in contrast to the usual aspect or be it sound aspect to life and more specifically to the past, to life's transitoriness and this includes that we approach, each of us are approaching death, in contrast to that I

maintain that in the past nothing is lost but right on the contrary everything is stored forever. It is not annihilated by transitoriness but on the contrary it has been, it is becoming preserved forever. Something you have done can never be undone. Something you have experienced something you have even experienced in a negative sense going through suffering and if for instance you suffered, gone through this suffering honestly courageously and with dignity who in the world, what what in the world can deny it, can annihilate this? What you have done

has been done forever in both ways in a negative as in a positive way, it cannot be undone. And the past is a storehouse of what you have done what you have experienced what you have gone through and what you have done out of all the negative and tragic aspects as even encountered within your life.

I want to thank you for being on the show and I want to thank you at home for watching.
