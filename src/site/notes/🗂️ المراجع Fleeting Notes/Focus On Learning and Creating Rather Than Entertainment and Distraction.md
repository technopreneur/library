Most people are distracted right now.

They’re distracted while they’re at work.

They’re distracted when they’re with family
and friends.

They’re distracted at the gym, on their
commute, and even in the shower.

The mediocre majority will continue going
through life this way, never experiencing

the fullness of a life filled with deep focus
and purpose.

Most people don’t prioritize learning and
creating.

They don’t care enough about any efforts
to invest in their personal development and

growth.

Entertainment is more important.

Most people have replaced achieving their
life dreams and goals with TV, partying, and

social media.

Their life is characterized by entertainment
and distraction, not learning and creating.

As a result, they don’t have close relationships.

They’re stuck in jobs they hate.

Their life is on the fast-track to disappointment,
and they don’t know what to do.

Benjamin Hardy once said, “Entertainment
and distraction is the enemy of creation and

learning.

They will keep you in mediocrity.”

If you don’t want to end up living a life
of mediocrity, focus on learning and education.

It’s the fastest way to become extraordinary,
wealthy, and successful.

Your income, relationships, and success are
determined by your learning.

Most people spend more money on entertainment
and gadgets than self-education.

This is why they remain poor and broke with
superficial relationships.

The quality of your learning and how much
you invest in yourself directly determines

the extent of your growth.

In the words of Ryan Holiday:
“The extent of the struggle determines the

extent of the growth.”

You are defined by what you’re willing to
struggle for.

Most people aren’t willing to really struggle
for anything.

They blindly accept what they’re given,
and spend their free time disengaging from

reality.

Renowned motivational speaker Jim Rohn once
said the most successful people in the world

are always lifelong learners.

They fully understand that their level of
education directly determines their quality

of life.

“Formal education makes a living, but self-education
makes a fortune,” Rohn explained.

It’s not just about a college degree.

Most of what you learn in college isn’t
applicable to real-world success.

It’s your self-education, the kind of learning
that helps you develop into the next evolution

of yourself.

Most people will continue to go through life
“in quiet desperation, with their songs

left unsung.”

Others dictate their income, their happiness,
and their fulfillment.

If you don’t want to end up with regret
on your death-bed, choose self-education over

entertainment.

Darren Hardy, author of The Compound Effect,
once told a story about how he ended up with

his wife.

When he was in his 20’s, he began compiling
an enormous list of every attribute he wanted

his future wife to have.

He eventually filled 40 pages detailing the
most exquisite and perfect match he could

think of.

At the end of his writing, he realized something
very important:

Any woman like that wouldn’t want to have
anything to do with someone like him!

Hardy realized he needed to become a far better
version of himself to attract a woman like

that.

You must become a far better version of yourself
to achieve the enormous success you want.

Benjamin Hardy put it this way: “We attract
into our lives what we are.”

Ask yourself — if you want a million dollars,
do you have the mindset of a millionaire?

Do you have the financial knowledge and self-discipline
to own that kind of money?

Most people don’t, yet they continue complaining
about being poor.

You’ll never become a millionaire if you
don’t become someone who could be a millionaire!

Every day, millions of people attract mediocre
opportunities into their lives — jobs, time

investments, dating partners, etc. — not
realizing they are attracting exactly who

they are!

Extremely successful people are magnets of
extraordinary opportunities.

They are individuals who gravitate towards
success, because they are successful themselves.

If you constantly engage in mediocre, subpar
activities with toxic individuals, you’ll

only receive similar opportunities.

You’ll never experience the type of success
of the world’s most extraordinary people,

because success is something you attract by
the person you become.

C.S. Lewis once described humans this way:
“We are like eggs at present.

And you cannot go on indefinitely being just
an ordinary, decent egg.

We must be hatched or go bad.”

You do not have the luxury to “wait” to
improve.

Like an egg, you’ll either progress into
a new version of yourself, or go rotten.

There is no other way.

Most people continue choosing security and
safety over the choice to become the fullest

version of themselves.

Louis Sachar said:
“So, what’s it going to be — safety,

or freedom?

You can’t have both.”

Right now, you have the choice — step forward
into growth and development, or step backwards

into safety and security.

Most people step backward, slowly killing
their chances to become extraordinary.

Seth Godin once said, “The problem is that
our culture has engaged in a Faustian bargain,

in which we trade our genius and artistry
for apparent stability.”

The sad truth is: there’s no such thing
as security.

Money can be taken away (how many times have
you heard of a multi-millionaire going bankrupt?).

Our health could fail at any time.

Millions of people are abruptly fired or laid
off every year.

Security isn’t real.

We must choose to design our own life, and
let go of our addiction to “apparent stability.”

If you’ve traded your genius and creativity
for “stability,” it’s time to get those

back.

Learning and self-education aren’t popular.

Most people don’t read books, attend seminars,
or take even the most basic steps for self-improvement.

They would rather choose distraction and entertainment.

Most people will never be successful because
they will spend their life this way.

With just a few small changes to your life,
you could enter into the top 5—10% of your

field.

The competition is extremely low!

Amazing, extraordinary opportunities are abundant,
because so few people ever take the steps

to discover them.

You can become one of the few truly successful
people in the world by taking your self-education

and learning seriously.

In a world of mediocrity, you can become extraordinary
with only a few simple tweaks.

So how do you start?

The more you keep evolving into better versions
of yourself, the more you’ll need to be

focused on the things that are most important.

Your days must be characterized by high-quality
activities and behaviors.

Benjamin Hardy put it this way: “Success
is continuously improving who you are, how

you live, how you serve, and how you relate.”

James Altucher once said, “Every day, check
these 4 boxes: Have I improved 1% on physical,

emotional, mental, and spiritual health?”

You can start small.

Even the smallest improvement is more than
most people will ever see.

While most people change slowly and unconsciously
over time, you can begin taking control of

your success by choosing to make a few small
improvements.

That’s all it takes.

Extraordinary people are very uncommon.

Their lifestyle of learning and self-education
aren’t popular, either.

Odds are, once you begin investing in yourself,
you’ll find it’s a lonely road.

Todd Brison wisely said, “The more bold
you are, the more rejection you’ll experience.”

The mob of the majority doesn’t like deserters.

If you want an extraordinary life, you’ll
need to give up many parts of the “normal”

life.

That might mean giving up common toxic behaviors
or hanging out with toxic people.

If “everyone does it,” you’d do well
to give it a long, hard look.

Most people will never achieve an extraordinary
life.

That’s OK.

The extraordinary life isn’t for everyone.

Learning and self-education take time, energy,
and focus that most people would rather spend

on entertainment and distraction — “ordinary”
things.

“Great” opportunities cost “good”
ones; you can’t have both.

Benjamin Hardy said:
Before you evolve, you can reasonably spend

time with just about anyone.

You can reasonably eat anything placed in
front of you.

You can reasonably justify activities and
behaviors that are, frankly, mediocre.

But as your vision expands, you realize you
need to make adjustments.

You can’t spend your money on junk anymore.

You need to manage your time much more diligently.

You need to invest in yourself and your future.

To avoid mediocrity, you can’t continue
being with negative people.

You can’t keep eating crappy foods that
slow you down.

You can’t do many of the things you used
to do.

This is what extraordinary requires.

Most people see the price and simply say “no
thanks.”

But you can do anything if you pay the price.

There are probably dozens of things you do
on a daily basis that aren’t helping you

improve.

Most people live their lives on other people’s
terms.

Their days are spent working on other people’s
goals and following the rules of someone else.

Entertainment and distraction rule society.

There will never be a shortage of TV shows,
Buzzfeed articles, or Bad Lip Reading videos

to take up your time.

If you want to avoid mediocrity and achieve
enormous success, you must cut out distractions

and prioritize learning instead.

Most people will go their whole lives as a
slave to entertainment.

They prioritize entertainment over improving
their life, their family’s well-being, and

their hopes and dreams.

This is how people can stay at jobs they hate
for years.

It’s how people stay in toxic relationships
and remain perpetually broke.

They don’t bother learning how to succeed.

If your lifestyle does not add to your growth
and improvement, it will bring you down.

Prioritize learning.

Invest in self-education.

Choose success over mediocrity.
