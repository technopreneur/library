A positive asymmetrical risk/reward occurs when the potential or realized reward is greater than the potential or realized loss.

When we speak of asymmetrical risk/reward, we typically mean it is a positive one. But, an asymmetric risk/reward can also be negative.

Asymmetric risk is the risk an investor faces when the gain realized from the move of an underlying asset in one direction is significantly different from the loss incurred from its move in the opposite direction.

Asymmetric reward is the reward an investor may achieve when the gain realized from the move of an underlying asset in one direction is significantly different from the loss incurred from its move in the opposite direction.
