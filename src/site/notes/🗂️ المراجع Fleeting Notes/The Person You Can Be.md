so what did i learn

from studying

from studying the terrible situation

that obtained in the mid 1980s when the

soviets

and the west had

tens of thousands of

hydrogen bombs pointed at each other

ready to go at a moment's notice

why did that happen what did i learn it

was simple

the reason

that that

situation existed

was because i was not good enough i was

not good enough the reason that the

terrible situations in the world exist

now is because you're not good enough

you're not good enough you're not good

enough

we could solve any problem

we can solve any problem if we used all

the resources that were available to us

if we live properly we have no idea what

we could turn what we're in into

so i would say

you support free speech because

it's the mechanism that maintains the

sanity of the individual and society

and you

live in relationship with the spoken

truth

to the best of your ability because the

alternative is hell and if hell is what

you want

then you can remain arrogant and

resentful and deceitful but if you want

to work to better the world to bring it

up to what it might be

then you speak

forthrightly you clarify yourself and

you act properly in the world

and then you see what happens

and this is the final thing i'll say

i spent a long time studying the sermon

on the mount it's a key

document

it's christ's commentary on the ten

commandments in a sense

the question being if you codify the

rules by which a society might function

is there something within the structure

of the rules that rises above them that

acts as the fundamental principle from

which they're all derived

it's the ultimate question of human

ethics what is the highest principle

and the answer that's put forth in the

sermon on the mount is quite

straightforward

aim at the highest possible good that

you can conceive of

whatever that is that you can conceive

of that serves as your god for all

intents and purposes

having aligned yourself with that good

speak the truth

and see what happens

that's the act of faith

the act of faith is

whatever the truth reveals is the best

of all possible worlds regardless of how

it appears to you now

it's a guess right it's it's something

you stake a bet on

well what do you think

the best of all possible worlds will be

brought into being by deceit

it seems unlikely you know that doesn't

work in your own life you tangle

yourself up in your own lies right one

lie breeds 10 and 10 breeds 100 and

maybe you put the consequences on down

the road and you don't fall into the pit

for five or six years maybe you've even

forgotten why you fell in when you

finally do fall in but everyone knows

that everyone knows that you don't get

away with anything

and so the issue is well what would

happen if you just said what you thought

stupid as it is inaccurate as it is and

listen to people criticize you in

response to shape you and make you more

articulate what would your life be like

and the answer to that is and i know

this to be true i've worked with many

many people on precisely this problem

your life gets better and better and

better and richer and deeper

but that comes with a heavier and

heavier burden of responsibility

well that's okay

you use the observation of your own

capability to bear responsibility

to buttress yourself against the terrors

of being finite

you say

weak and miserable as i am

i can still stand up to the terrible

tragedy of life and prevail

and that's good enough

[Music]

we have to conserve the idea that the

individual has an infinite

responsibility to the direction of being

and we know that you know perfectly well

that you live in a relationship with

your own conscience

and when you violate the moral order

that's part and parcel of your soul

you're ashamed and hide and bitter

and then you get angry you can't show

your face to other people you can't even

look at yourself in the mirror and you

know perfectly well that's true even

though you may not know what to do about

it or how to get out of it

it's there's a moral order built into

human beings

if there wasn't there's no way we could

even communicate with one another

because there'd be no rules of

communication there'd be nothing that we

mutually wanted or expected from each

other you know one of the things i

figured out is that we're all appalled

when we run into another person who is

not yet the redeemer

every person you ever meet you're you're

dissatisfied with because they're not

who they could be and you're

broadcasting that message at everyone

all the time you're not who you could be

you're not who you could be you're not

who you could be i'm not who i could be

and we're all

facing each other with our emotional

displays

pleading with each other to become that

which we could become

and everyone knows it

but we won't do it and it's no wonder

the post-modernists

they're the they're the logical

conclusion of the nietzschean dilemma

god is dead value

the value structure collapsed

the specter arises of all value

structures collapsing

that's the postmodernist dogma all value

structures have collapsed

they're only there for the purposes of

exclusion they have no intrinsic value

it's a very very powerful argument

that's why it dominates the universities

that and the fact that allows people

decision to dispense with their moral

responsibility which is something that's

never discussed by the post-modernists

but you have to give the devil his due

what's the problem with post-modernism

well if all value structures have

collapsed

then there's nothing to do

because in order to do something one

thing has to be better than another

because otherwise why do it

and so people who are ensconced in the

post-modern tradition

are undermined by their own philosophy

they can deconstruct their own

deconstruction in which case they might

as well just sit there and do nothing

which would actually be preferable to

what they're doing now

so how do they

extract themselves from that dilemma

they do it illogically but they don't

care because the postmodernists first of

all don't believe in logic that's a

reflection of the logos which they've

dispensed with

dialogue they don't believe in because

that's a reflection of the logos which

they've dispensed with

logic and dialogue are irrelevant well

that does bring up the problem of what

to do well the post-modernist finesse

that by reverting to the marxist

doctrines from which post-modernism

emerged and so they say well yeah you

can't get any direction from

post-modernism but we don't we're not

going to worry about that because we

don't worry about such things what we'll

do is just

use sleight of hand to

push forward the communitarian doctrines

out of which our original hypothesis

emerged and everyone says well we'll

turn a blind eye to the paradox because

we actually need something to do and

plus to the degree that we're

communitarian we can take out our

nihilistic resentment and arrogance and

ingratitude on every single person we

deem to have something more than we have

and so if you're wondering why

certain values can exist in the absence

of any value

you have to look no farther than to

understand that people who are desperate

and chaotic will still be angry and

destructive

and they can manifest that perfectly

with the moral mask that says well i'm

not really after what you have

because you have a little more than me

i'm speaking on behalf of these people

who have even less it's like it's

absolute nonsense

it's so funny watching yale students

complain about the privileged

they're in the top 1 10th of 100th of a

percent of people who've lived in in the

entire history of the planet much less

just the people that are on the planet

now they're

dominating patriarchs in training right

they're baby representatives of the

patriarchy and all they do is complain

about that tiny tiny infinitesimal

fraction of people who have slightly

more than they have now

it's appalling and their idiot

professors pat them on the back and send

them out the world to do that

instead of teaching them how to live

[Music]

well as far as i can tell

the alternative is a proper return to

the past and that is precisely to

journey into the chaos to look at the

worst possible thing and to pull the

dead father up from the chaotic depths

that's how you stop being a puppet

someone whose strings are being pulled

by forces they do not understand behind

the scenes

you find out what's great about your

culture this thing that's provided us

with everything that we see in this room

this amazing warmth that we're

experiencing when it's dirty bloody

below outside the fact that the

electricity on and the computational

resources are working that we can all

sit here peacefully and then no one is

hungry in fact we're too fat that's our

big problem oh no

we have so much stuff we're getting fat

yeah well that's a good problem to have

we should have some gratitude for what's

being produced that's brought us to this

point and we need to wake up and

understand what we're doing that's what

the psychoanalysts were trying to do in

the 20th century that's what all the

great clinicians were trying to do and i

would say above all else that was what

carl jung was trying to do

he believed firmly that

the idea of the divine spark within the

individual was a was a metaphysical

reality by which he meant a reality that

actually transcended and and and existed

super ordinate to the physical reality a

more real reality that's whatever

consciousness is something we understand

from a scientific perspective not at all

that's been represented in our

mythologies as far back as we can push

them as an independent agent in the

world

giving rise to form

that's how we treat each other that's

how we recognize ourselves

that's how we judge each other

you make your bed and then you lie in it

and everyone knows it and that's not to

say that you're not subject to random

and chaotic circumstances and the

tragedy of life just because you can do

some things doesn't mean you can do

everything

but you can do some things and if you

don't do them then things fall apart

[Music]

you
