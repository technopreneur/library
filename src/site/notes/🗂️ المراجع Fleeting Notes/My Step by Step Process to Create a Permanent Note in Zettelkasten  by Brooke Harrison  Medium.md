Heard of the Zettelkasten note-taking method and always wanted to give it a shot?

Me too. The Zettelkasten or “slip-box” method emphasizes *connection* and inspired the bidirectional linking of programs like Obsidian and Roam Research.

If you’ve heard of this method, attributed to German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, you might think that you know a thing or two about it… Index cards! “Linking” similar ideas!

Thing is, there are a few principles we need to understand in order to reap its rewards. Zettelkasten *changes* the way we consume information and take notes… Luhmann’s “permanent” notes were written in complete sentences, in his own words. (I don’t know about you, but I’ve never taken notes so neatly. Mine are typically a mess of quotes, bullet points, key phrases, etc.)

**So… what constitutes a “permanent” note?** How do we take the content we’ve consumed and create notes for our own Zettelkasten?

There’s a lot out there about how Zettelkasten works in *theory*, but very little to SHOW us how it works in *practice*. So I’m going to show you one of my own permanent notes — and, more importantly, how I got there. But first…

## Luhmann’s “note-making” process

The Zettelkasten method is intentional and thoughtful. Luhmann followed a 3-step process to facilitate *learning* and *understanding*…

1.  **Read;** take “literature notes” to jot down the bits of information that were most compelling
2.  **Elaborate;** transform literature notes into “permanent” notes for the Zettelkasten
3.  **Connect;** think critically about where the note belongs and how it connects to preexisting threads of thought

Luhmann never “copy/pasted” from his own reading material, but rather processed what he’d read and then elaborated on the ideas or concepts he found most interesting. His notes, then, were not simply *summaries* of a particular text, but a unique thought of his own (inspired by the original source).

## Let’s break down Luhmann’s three types of notes

Each serves its own purpose, but understanding the difference between them will help us understand how Zettelkasten works:

1.  **“Fleeting” notes**

These are the quick thoughts or ideas you need to jot down immediately so as not to forget them. In *How to Take Smart Notes,* Sonke Ahrens describes fleeting notes as “reminders of information.” At this early stage, there’s no pressure to use full sentences or use your own words.

It’s what we *do* with our fleeting notes that matters…

**2\. “Literature” notes**

These notes summarize your thoughts on a particular text. A “literature” note is tied to its source material. Luhmann stored these notes separately, in a reference system that was meant to save his bibliographic sources.

But keep in mind that these are *not* permanent notes…

**3\. Permanent notes**

These are the notes that are added to your Zettelkasten, written in complete sentences and in your own words. Maybe this sounds intimidating, but it doesn’t need to be an essay. In fact, we’re meant to add only one idea per note. The point here is that your permanent notes capture an independent thought that *elaborates* on the source rather than *summarizes* it.

> “Permanent notes… are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.” ~ Sonke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes

## The 3 types of notes in practice

I’m watching a [video series by YA author Maggie Stiefvater,](https://www.etsy.com/listing/806360184/writing-with-maggie-stiefvater-8-hour) a seminar on creative writing. **In this example, we’ll move from (1) fleeting notes, to (2) a literature note, and finally (3) the permanent note for my Obsidian “Zettelkasten” or slip-box.**

## **Fleeting Notes**

As I watch the videos, I keep a notebook in front of me. I jot down “fleeting notes” as I’m listening. These are “fleeting” notes because they’re mere “reminders of information,” usually in the form of quotes, blurbs, or bullet points. I wouldn’t call this a true “literature” note because I haven’t taken the time to elaborate in complete sentences:

**What would happen if we stopped here?**

Before experimenting with Zettelkasten, I’d take notes like the handwritten pages in the photo above, and then never touch them again. I have stacks of abandoned notebooks filled with scribbled thoughts and ideas from books, podcasts, videos, etc. that I’ve entirely forgotten.

There is nothing “wrong” with taking notes this way. I’ve made it this far in life, haven’t I? But here’s the thing… as I scan the notes in that photograph, I realize I’ve already lost some of the meaning. And for you? My notes probably make very little sense — especially if you haven’t watched Stiefvater’s video, which is the source material for these notes.

This is because “fleeting notes” are often devoid of context. These are *my* handwritten notes — and yet, they’re not of much use to me anymore.

Luckily, I *didn’t* stop here, and I moved forward with Luhmann’s method…

## I wrote what I \*thought\* was a permanent note

Here’s what happened next… After I took these notes, I felt so inspired that I opened up Obsidian and word-vomited my takeaways from Stiefvater’s video about “mood.” At the time, I thought this counted as my “permanent note” for the Zettelkasten because I’d taken the time to elaborate in my own words, in complete sentences.

I went back later and realized that this word dump read more like a “literature note,” which makes sense, as lit notes are meant to be a *bridge* between your fleeting notes and a fully-formed permanent note. **In case you’re curious, here’s a peek at that original word dump:**

Let me just say that I think each of us will have a different idea of what constitutes a true “permanent note.” In this case, I looked back on my “word dump” and realized it was more of a summary of Stiefvater’s video, rather than a unique thought or interpretation of my own.

Interestingly enough, as I continued re-reading my ramble-y mess, I found that I’d moved from summarizing Stiefvater’s points to making my own. (And that’s the part that would become my “permanent note.”)

**So, for the purpose of this exercise, I cleaned up the original word dump to create two distinct notes — a “literature” note and a “permanent” note — for you to see the difference.** *\*I wanted to be transparent that I wrote the following notes* after the fact *because I certainly didn’t do it perfectly at the time.\**

## Literature Note

This “literature” note summarizes what I learned from Stiefvater’s writing seminar about “mood.”

## Permanent Note

My “permanent” note takes that concept from Stiefvater’s seminar — beginning a novel by deciding its “mood” — and elaborates on it to create a unique thought of my own. Still, of course, inspired and informed by Stiefvater’s videos (which is why I’ve linked the literature note at the top, as my reference).

See how these notes are much shorter than my original rambling word dump? Keep in mind that Zettelkasten notes are not meant to be lengthy, well-written essays. If that were the case, we probably wouldn’t do it. Whether it’s a single paragraph or only a few lines, each note is meant to be “atomic” in that it contains just ONE idea.

## Creating notes that are valuable to me in future

Full transparency: this is very new to me! Taking notes in this way is not what I’m used to, and it’s clunky and slow. This process has forced me to slow down, and consume content more intentionally.

I’ve already learned a lot in following these steps. Yes, it took time, but I’m proud that my notes have clarified my thoughts on the concept of “mood.” While I can’t say that the “permanent” note I’ve written in this example is in line with what Luhmann would have done, I’m not going for perfection. I’ve written a note that I believe will be valuable to me in future, and that’s the ultimate goal.
