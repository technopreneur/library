The Life of the Mind: the philosophic pioneer, Socrates (ca.469–399 B.C.)

**Intellectualism** is the mental perspective that emphasizes the use, the development, and the exercise of the [intellect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellect "Intellect"); and also identifies the life of the mind of the [intellectual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual "Intellectual") person.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-Merriam-1) In the field of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), "intellectualism" is synonymous with [rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism"), knowledge derived from [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason "Reason").[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-HighBeam-2) Sociologically, the term *intellectualism* can also have a socially negative connotation about a man or woman intellectual who gives "too much attention to thinking" (single-mindedness of purpose) and who shows an "absence of affection and feeling" (emotional coldness).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-HighBeam-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-encarta-3) Hierarchical Intellectualism or hierarchical theory of intelligence is any theory of intelligence postulating that the abilities constituting intelligence are arranged in a series of levels (of a hierarchy) ranging from general to specific.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-4) Most notable Hierarchical Intellectualism is the use of the [IQ test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_test "IQ test").

## Ancient moral intellectualism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intellectualism&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Ancient moral intellectualism")\]

The Greek philosopher [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") (c. 470–399 BC) said that intellectualism allows that "one will do what is right or \[what is\] best, just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best"; that [virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue "Virtue") is a matter of the intellect, because virtue and [Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") are related qualities that a person accrues, possesses, and improves by dedication to the use of [Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason "Reason").[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-5) Socrates's definition of [moral intellectualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_intellectualism "Moral intellectualism") is a basis of the philosophy of [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism "Stoicism"), wherein the consequences of that definition are called "Socratic paradoxes", such as "There is no [weakness of will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness_of_will "Weakness of will")", because a person either knowingly does evil or knowingly seeks to do evil (moral wrong); that anyone who does commit evil or seeks to commit evil does so involuntarily; and that virtue is knowledge, that there are few virtues, but that all virtues are one.

The conceptions of Truth and of Knowledge of contemporary philosophy are unlike Socrates’s conceptions of Truth and Knowledge and of ethical conduct, and cannot be equated with modern, [post–Cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesianism "Cartesianism") [conceptions of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptions_of_knowledge "Conceptions of knowledge") and rational intellectualism.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-6) In that vein, by way of detailed study of history, [Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault "Michel Foucault") demonstrated that in [Classical Antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Antiquity "Classical Antiquity") (800 BC – AD 1000), "knowing the truth" was akin to "spiritual knowledge", which is integral to the principle of "caring for the self".

In effort to become a [moral person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics) "Value (ethics)") the care for the self is realised through [ascetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascetic "Ascetic") exercises meant to ensure that knowledge of truth was learned and integrated to the Self. Therefore, to understand truth meant possessing "intellectual knowledge" that integrated the self to the (universal) truth and to living an [authentic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticity_(philosophy) "Authenticity (philosophy)") life. Achieving that ethical state required continual care for the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the [Classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric "Rhetoric")\-era rhetorical device of *[parrhesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrhesia "Parrhesia")*: "to speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking"; and, by extension, to practice the [moral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality "Morality") obligation to speak truth for the common good, even at personal risk.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-7)

## Medieval theological intellectualism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intellectualism&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Medieval theological intellectualism")\]

**Medieval theological intellectualism** is a doctrine of divine action, wherein the faculty of [intellect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellect "Intellect") precedes, and is superior to, the faculty of the [will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_(philosophy) "Will (philosophy)") (*voluntas intellectum sequitur*). As such, Intellectualism is contrasted with [voluntarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy) "Voluntarism (philosophy)"), which proposes the Will as superior to the intellect, and to the emotions; hence, the stance that "according to intellectualism, choices of the Will result from that which the intellect recognizes as good; the will, itself, is determined. For voluntarism, by contrast, it is the Will which identifies which objects are good, and the Will, itself, is indetermined".[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-IEP-8) From that philosophical perspective and historical context, the Spanish [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") polymath [Averroës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averro%C3%ABs "Averroës") (1126–1198) in the 12th century, the Italian Christian theologian [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") (1225–1274), and the German Christian theologian [Meister Eckhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meister_Eckhart "Meister Eckhart") (1260–1327) in the 13th century, are recognised intellectualists.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-IEP-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism#cite_note-9)
