**Title:** (2) The Free AI Tool that Knows Everything You've Written (Obsidian with AI) - YouTube

- **Presenter:** Brian McNulty, founder of Heights Platform and builder of the first autonomous coach for creators.
  
- **Tool Introduced:** Obsidian 
  - Available for free at obsidian.md.
  - While commonly known as a note-taking app, Obsidian also supports community plugins.
  - Two AI plugins in Obsidian: Copilot and Smart Connections.
  - These plugins require users to input their OpenAI API key.

- **Features of Obsidian:**
  - **Copilot Plugin:** 
    - Essentially integrates Chat GPT with your notes.
    - Allows users to ask AI about the content of the notes.
    - Users can extract interesting ideas from their notes.
    - Can save the AI chat history.
    - Acts as a built-in Chat GPT for the notes.
  
  - **Smart Connections Plugin:** 
    - Creates vector embeddings of all notes.
    - Allows AI to understand the meaning of a text and its relation to other texts.
    - Helps in finding similar notes based on the content.
    - Assists users in searching notes based on meaning, not just keywords.
    - Provides a list of similar notes with a similarity percentage score.
    - Can answer queries about all notes as a whole.

- **Advantages of these AI features:**
  - Reduce the effort of manually organizing notes.
  - Easily find related content or previously mentioned topics.
  - Ideal for creators who want to synthesize and repurpose their notes for other uses.
  - Enhance productivity by automating note analysis.

- **Use Case Example:** 
  - Brian took transcripts of his podcast "The Creator's Adventure" and used the Copilot plugin to extract the most interesting things said during the podcast.

- **Recommendation:** 
  - The AI tools in Obsidian simplify note organization and analysis.
  - Downloading and setting up is quick and mostly free (except potential OpenAI API costs).
  - Useful for creators, especially those developing online courses or digital content.

the AI tool I'm going to show you today allows you to instantly analyze anything that you've ever written or said a little bit of background on me I have built the first autonomous coach for creators my name is Brian McNulty I've been building a Latin AI I'm the founder of heights platform but there are so many great AI tools out there and the one I'm about to show you I cannot believe there aren't more people talking about it I'm going to show you the exact workflow that I use let's get into it

okay the tool I'm going to show you is called obsidian you can download it for free at obsidian.md if you want to follow along with this video and if you're watching this and saying wait a second I've heard of obsidian that is just a note-taking app what are you talking about that has nothing to do with AI well there are Community plugins inside this app and two of them specifically have these AI options in them that are incredibly powerful and it's all free to use other than plugging in your open AI API key so I'm going to

show you exactly how to set all that up and what it actually does all right so let's head over to obsidian.md and here you can go ahead and download it for free now this is available on pretty much every platform but for the purposes of following Along on this video you're going to want to download it on your computer because I believe that the AI plugins at least for now only work on the desktop version okay so now we're inside obsidian this is a note I have open here already I already put a bunch of my notes into

here and to get started we want to First have you install these two AI plugins that I'm talking about so you're going to go into your settings and you'll see an option here for Community plugins now I'm going to try to make this video strictly about these two plugins it's really easy to go down the rabbit hole here and start trying out all these different plugins and customizing everything so I encourage you not to do that just yet let's focus on the these two plugins later on if you want to go

down the rabbit hole you can I'll scroll through the plugins that I am using here if you want to take a look at the ones that I do have enabled to try those out for yourself at some point later but the two that are AI is specific are called copilot and smart connections so copilot is the one here and to install these plugins you're going to go to community plugins click browse and so we can type in Copilot this is the one by Logan Yang and then the other might as well install that now as well is uh smart connections by Brian Petro

so install both of those quick and let's see actually yeah it can so it can tell us about the plugin a little bit here and now these each do something a little bit similar but they have different uses uh at least for now so smart connections what it will do is it will create these Vector embeddings of everything in all of your notes and what that means is the vector embedding is essentially this mathematical representation of what your note actually means and this is really important because in my mind at least

one of the big problems with these second brain type note-taking tools is it takes so much time just to organize all of your nodes because I mean once you get it all connected and then can say like oh well this one references that one yes it can be powerful but there's a lot of time that has to be invested into doing that so what this is going to do is by creating these Vector embeddings with the AI it's going to understand what is the meaning of a particular piece of text and how does that relate to another piece of text

meaning that if you have these two notes that are actually similar similar but don't have the same keywords the AI will still be able to recognize that there's a similarity there and this is really powerful for yourself because when you go to search for something you might say oh did I ever write about this topic or that topic and then you find out that you can't find it because you can't think of the exact word that you used in this case the AI can help you search for that because it understands that the

word that you're saying right now is similar to this note that you wrote here so what smart connections is going to do is it's going to make all those connections for you and on any note that you view you'll be able to see which notes are similar and it kind of lists them in a percentage score it shows it down here actually on the right I'll show that more in a second so that's what smart connections is going to do really briefly and then Copilot is can kind of be thought of as having a chat GPT basically integrated into your

notes and able to understand the notes that you're currently working on so I use both of these but for slightly different purposes because smart connections does have this chat mode too for a copilot here's uh some examples of this they actually do now have that if you have a powerful enough computer and really want to get into this you can install a local model to be able to run AI just on your computer you don't even need internet you don't have to pay for any API usage or anything like that

in my opinion that that starts to get complicated so if you already have some experience with that you know uh what they're talking about there then you might want to venture into that if not let's stick to using uh open Ai and their API key so you can use chatgpt GPT 3.

5 and gpt4 with your notes so let's go ahead make sure you click up here to install both of those and now I'm going to show you how they actually work so here at first uh what we're looking at now is actually a chat history that I saved from using copilot and what for me was one of the most powerful uses here was to be able to take all the transcripts of my podcast I have a podcast called The Creator's Adventure if you want to learn about how other creators are growing their businesses I interviewed them there so check that out the creatorsadventure.com you can find

more of that if you're on our YouTube channel right now it's also on our YouTube but so what I did here is I essentially took all of the transcripts of everything that I ever said on the podcast and now I can ask questions about that and so what's really powerful is I can open up any note and here is I'm going to show you the exact prompt and everything that I use right here it's really pretty simple um let's go to this one here so I have all my transcripts from all my guests right here and it's just this basically

jumbled piece of text it's not even formatted how I got the transcript and then uh on the right side here I opened up the copilot and so the copilot plugin we're going to have the model cell auction we can choose uh what we want it to be I'm going to use gpt4 because it'll give me a little bit better quality and then we have these different options here so I want to change this to active note and when I change this to active note now you can see it says feel free to ask me questions about and what that means

is it has now embedded just this individual note the problem with something like chat GPT is I can't just go ahead and paste these giant transcripts into it because it's not going to have enough memory to actually remember all of it but when it's able to use this Vector embedding like this it's able to pull out the pieces that it thinks are going to be meaningful and then just use those so it can fit inside its memory so I'm going to paste in my prompt right here let's see it's not

uh too big in this little text box but I'll read it off to you so it says extract and list the most interesting ideas presented here do not include those that involve introducing or reading someone's bio after each idea write the quote that um it is from in the text and so the purpose of me doing this right here is I want to figure out what are some interesting things that I happen to have said in my own podcast but I don't want to talk about like what was interesting in me reading the person's bio in the introduction because

that wouldn't be included in this so I'm going to go ahead and hit send and now we'll wait a moment and the AI is going to generate a response for us all right so we can see that AI is writing a response here for us and what's really neat is it's doing what I said here it's writing out an idea and then it's following that up with the exact quote so I can go and find it in the transcript if I want to so basically when I'm using this particular prompt for is it's going to let me

figure out what are some interesting things that I could talk about maybe repurpose for something else on social media or anything like that and that essentially that use case is what I think is so powerful for the average Creator to take everything that you've ever said and then ask questions about it in ways that you can basically synthesize your notes into different ways of being able to use them so that is copilot um really basically right there you can ask it questions about the note that you currently have

open we could go ahead and save this conversation as a note um if we want to make sure that we have all that later on and you can also just use it like a chat gbt built into your notes so if you're typing out something trying to write something and you want to select something and paste it in here ask a question about that specifically you could do that too and now the next part is smart connections you'll notice here on the right side there is this list of other notes with a percentage next to it and

this here is the similarity of this note between the other ones and what I did here is you'll notice that it also found like okay all these are the transcripts it can tell that all these transcripts are kind of similar compared to some other like more personal note that I might have written and so this is great because anything you write you don't have to worry about manually linking it and saying oh this one is related to this so that way I can find it later the AI here is going to do it for you with the smart connections

and so to be clear because I didn't show this exactly before we're going to go into the settings and I'll show you how this works so for copilot you want to go here and get your openai API key if you've used chat gbt and have an open AI account then you can probably go ahead and get this you want to just follow the link here of where you can copy it and now this will cost money to use but especially if you're going to use GPT 3.

5 and not gpt4 yet the amount of money that it costs is so so small it's going to be way way less than paying for chat GPT plus even if you're using it pretty often so you've got copilot right here and then for smart connections it's pretty similar you paste in your open AI API key here as well and then this one also lets you choose a default model and how you want it to work now so let's see how smart connections works and how it's different than Copilot smart connections I keep open in a separate tab right here

and what's really powerful about smart connections compared to copilot is copilot acts as like your chat gbt plus asking questions about the note that you're currently working on and smart connections not only has these connections for you for related notes but what it will also do is allow you to ask questions about all of your notes as a whole and this is really neat because you can say something like what's the most surprising thing I've ever said and it will be able to give you that response and figure those things out for

you so if you ever thought like oh did I ever talk about this thing before or what are some opinions that I had on x then you can use Smart connections to ask questions about all of your notes as a whole and get those answers okay so let's try this out and ask it a question and I'm going to ask it something related to what I've said about course creation because my business Heights platform we have an online course creation software so I'm sure I've said some things related to creating online

courses so let's type out based on my notes um what are maybe let's say um the most unexpected the most unexpected things I have said about creating online courses now let's see what the AI says all right so the most unexpected thing I have said about creating online courses is the fundamental reasons customers are buying your online course is because they will believe it will help them achieve a specific result this means it's not just about teaching them a skill or knowledge but rather about focusing on the outcome or

transformation your course can provide okay well I say that quite a lot um so that makes sense all right so I hope that gives you a good example here of what you could potentially use this for I think it's really really powerful to be able to feel more confident that you can just put all your notes in here put all of your transcripts from any of your recordings from a podcast from your YouTube videos and then be able to ask questions about it so AI is really good at categorizing things as well and some neat things I think it could be for you

to try would be able to take something and maybe create like a rating system this is something else I'm experimenting with like taking a transcript of something that maybe it's a video you know did really really well and then taking a transcript of a video or a script that you're working on and then asking the AI like on a scale of one to ten rate this for how interesting it is how good the intro is how captivating whatever part is and then ask it to compare those two things and then see how your new one turns out

so you kind of have this reviewer for yourself as you're creating your own content and really I think those kind of things are the best use of AI where you're not using it to create the content for you but rather as this assistant to help you create the content easier so you no longer have to be overwhelmed about the idea of spending all this time to try to organize your notes and get used to a program like this now you can simply put everything there don't even worry if it's organized or not and use tools like smart

connections and copilot and obsidian to be able to get the answers that you need I really hope this has been helpful to you I really encourage you to go ahead and download this today costs basically nothing only takes a few minutes to set up and I really think that tools like this are going to make a big impact on how creators like yourself can build more in in the future and it's things like this that are even making me consider like should I buy some separate audio recorder maybe even just use the one like on my phone or my watch and

just record everything that I say that way I can put it into here later on and be able to ask the AI questions about what are the most important things I talked about today what's what's my agenda for today what are the things that I know I was working on today to make sure I have them done for tomorrow anything like that so it's a really great way now to take all the ideas that you might have and be able to get access to them so much easier without having to keep it all inside your head or spend

hours to organize it and if you're a Creator if you're building an online course maybe a paid Community maybe offering some digital downloads then check out Heights AI coach it is the first autonomous coach for creators and we've got a 30-day free trial at heightsplatform.
