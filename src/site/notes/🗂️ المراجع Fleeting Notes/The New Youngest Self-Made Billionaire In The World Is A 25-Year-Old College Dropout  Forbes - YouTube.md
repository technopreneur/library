When Massachusetts Institute of Technology dropout Alexandr Wang made the Forbes 30 Under 30 Enterprise Technology list in 2018, his startup Scale used artificial intelligence to begin automating tasks like image recognition and audio transcription. Back then, its customers included GM Cruise, Alphabet, Uber, P&G and others Now Wang, 25, is the youngest self-made billionaire. And while he still partners with buzzy companies, today he’s got $350 million in government defense contracts. This has helped Scale hit a $7.3 billion valuation, and give Wang a $1 billion net worth (as he owns 15% of the company). Scale’s technology analyzes satellite images much faster than human analysts to determine how much damage Russian bombs are causing in Ukraine. It’s useful not just for the military. More than 300 companies, including General Motors and Flexport, use Scale, which Wang started when he was 19, to help them pan gold from rivers of raw information—millions of shipping documents, say, or raw footage from self-driving cars. “Every industry is sitting on huge amounts of data,” Wang says, who appeared on the Forbes Under 30 list in 2018. “Our goal is to help them unlock the potential of the data and supercharge their businesses with AI.” Read the full story on Forbes: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/colehort...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFJJZ240MWNwN1VxdlVJR19KT0Y4QXNFYjhLQXxBQ3Jtc0trWEh4TDFnSjVKa1NPb2dsUWpfV3F5YmtIbldVWGdIcEVDRm5KUmRzS1lqcjNNdGxvZjZWR2FiRFJNSGh5TV9sa0FDU0JBNTUyTjlHbzVBa25HM3J2bGVEYV93WE5lYW9IbXgtckFNZG8zcGxWLTdsMA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fcolehorton%2F2022%2F05%2F25%2Fthe-new-youngest-self-made-billionaire-in-the-world-is-a-25-year-old-college-dropout%2F%3Fsh%3D180cf292494b%26utm_source%3Dnewsletter%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dunder30%26cdlcid%3D5cc06ab31802c8c524853545&v=FgzyLoSkL5k) 

[Music]

when you know in math and science and

physics and you know these fields

there's always a right answer you're

either you're right or you're wrong and

i actually think that teaches you some

of the wrong lessons

[Music]

i remember really vividly some of my

early violin lessons where you can get

all the notes right but that actually

isn't what mattered what mattered is

that you could

weave through the notes the emotion and

the story that the original composer was

trying to to convey and i think that was

it was really powerful lesson because i

think you know one thing that many of us

learn over time is that a lot of times

it's not about something being

clinically correct or clinically right

or exactly right it's about how they

kind of make people feel

and i think that that

definitely is true in technology and

it's definitely true in everything that

we try to build

my name is alexander wang i'm the ceo

and founder of scale ai

scale ai is the data infrastructure for

ai to power the most ambitious ai

projects in the world every organization

wants to implement ai but oftentimes the

the biggest bottleneck in their way is

being able to create really high quality

data and data sets to power that ai at

scale we sort of view data as the the

core problem of building great ai

whereas a lot of other companies view it

as an afterthought and that really

prevents ai from having sort of the

magnitude of outcomes that it's able to

have

we've raised over 600 million dollars to

date and we work with everywhere from

the largest automakers in the world like

toyota and general motors to the united

states department of defense to some of

the largest enterprises in the world

like microsoft square and paypal and

some of the leading ai research

organizations like openai

when you learn how to program for the

first time it's

it's kind of shocking but you actually

are generally sort of telling the

computer to do very simple things the

art of programming traditionally is the

art of sort of giving computers very

black and white instructions very simple

instructions that anybody could follow

and one of the the beauties of ai is

that you actually have the ability to

program computers with judgment and with

reasoning and with sort of

nuanced understanding of the world and

so you can have an ai system look at an

image and tell you what's in the image

or

listen to an audio snippet and

understand what's being said and it is

sort of this

incredible enabler for

what computers can do or the power of

computing and in general i think we've

already seen

sort of over the past many decades what

the power of

computers and computing and mobile

phones and all that stuff has been on

humanity and i think ai and machine

learning has a huge opportunity to do

the same

both my parents are physicists and i

grew up in the small town in new mexico

called los alamos new mexico where

there's a national lab

and a lot of the people i grew up with

had parents who were scientists of some

sort it was a sort of very special place

and my mom from very young age taught me

about math and physics and science and

you know she taught me with such wonders

i was really impatient as a kid i think

i always

wanted to be

learning more or i always want to be

doing more always wanted to sort of be

accomplishing more and so i actually uh

i left high school after my junior year

of high school and then

moved out to silicon valley to work as a

software engineer i learned so much

about building products about

about what it meant to

sort of like be metrics focused and data

focused and what it sort of meant to

build great software and then uh that's

when i was inspired by ai i sort of saw

it in my daily work i was like ai's

really cool and i went back to mit and

then after about a year of mit i dropped

out to start scale we have over 500

people now so um it's it's pretty insane

to watch

you know what originally started as a

you know few people in a in the basement

of our investor to

what it's what it's sort of become

where we started was uh in autonomous

vehicles and self-driving and i think it

was one of the first real use cases and

applications of ai that i think caught

the imagination of the world you know

what if we could have

unlimited easy

uh eco-friendly transportation

everywhere in the world uh through

autonomous vehicles

one of the examples that

we get really excited about is in

healthcare in healthcare there's a huge

bottleneck in

the number of doctors trained doctors

all around the world and there's

incredible potential for

ai and machine learning to actually

analyze as many of the cases as possible

automatically before

needing escalation to a doctor so the

doctors can spend their time on cases

with anomalies or erratic data or

whatnot and so at scale we actually did

research with mit on using ai and

machine learning to analyze dermatology

uh data and dermatology imaging to see

how ai can actually automate that

process and then therefore unblock the

sort of doctor bottleneck

another use case that that i'm really

passionate about is using ai to help

solve some of the largest geopolitical

problems and working with governments in

being able to sort of provide technology

to aid in some of these very tough and

tricky situations

in the war with russian ukraine we

actually

deployed scales technology in

understanding satellite imagery of major

ukrainian cities uh kharkiv kiev and

nipro

to understand what was the amount of

damage in key parts of these cities and

so we we analyzed using machine learning

as well as satellite imagery and

identified uh

all sorts of structures in these cities

where there was meaningful damage that

wasn't otherwise uh being addressed or

captured by humanitarian efforts and so

i'm incredibly excited by our work there

and actually enabling sort of

humanitarian efforts enabling us to

respond to some of the world's

most pressing and exigent

problems

in the world of ai there's i think a lot

of very smart people but who are focused

you know so far out in the future that

it's almost unhelpful you know there's

so many people focused on what's going

to happen when we have agi or what's

going to happen you know two or three

decades in the future and i think

there's not enough people who are really

focused on

what are the problems that we have today

and how can we use artificial

intelligence and machine learning to

really changed the game today and so um

i think what's next for us is to be

the people some of the people hopefully

in the world who are focused on how do

we solve some of the biggest problems

today around climate around agriculture

around geopolitics around medicine

and really

start making an impact you know now
