Bookstores have always driven me crazy. So much to read and so little time! And now with our lives chock full of CONTENT--Netlflix, podcasts, social media, YouTube, and the 24 hour news cycle--when the hell are we supposed to find the time to get through a book? This has haunted me for awhile now. So I decided to make a film about it, hoping to find a way through my bookstore anxiety--a way to re-balance my content diet in order to read more books. 

Bookstores drive me crazy.

I'm not talking about libraries, or used bookstores, or art bookstores, or museum bookstores.

I'm talking about book stores that sell new books.

Crisp, unworn, unwrinkled books.

Books with no past. No stains.

No previous owners.

But why? Why do they drive me so crazy?

Well, I think it has something to do with the cover art or the colorful and coordinated patterns of their spines.

Bookstores are basically like art galleries with stories attached.

Another thing that blows my mind about bookstores is how powerful the merchandise is.

This book started a war, this book invoked a fatwa,

this book was passed down orally for hundreds of years and here they all sit before you and I barely read any of them. and

This is really what drives me insane.

There's so many books, but not enough time. Between Netflix, podcasts,

Social media, binge worthy cable shows, The New Yorker, and the 24-hour news cycle.

How the fuck am I supposed to find time to pick up a book?

I guess if I had to describe this feeling it would be like the reading version of FOMO.

Which is just exacerbated by the staff picks section or those little award stickers.

I can never leave the bookstore without buying at least three books and we all know what happens to them.

So my quest is twofold. First, I'm gonna search for the most beautiful

bookstore in the world.

Well, not really the whole world, mostly just Western Europe and South America. And second,

I'm gonna ask a bunch of incredibly smart people to help me figure out how to read more books.

Because right now my whole content diet is out of whack and if I continue at this pace, I'm gonna know jack-shit before I die.

I want to first...

show you what you're currently doing because that will actually stress you out in a way that I think will be helpful.

This is Tim Urban

He's an entrepreneur,

A TED speaker and has a pretty influential blog called Wait But Why,

which influences the likes of well Elon Musk.

I Figured if anyone could help me get perspective on my book store anxiety, it would be him. Okay. So how much do you read?

I probably read, look if I'm being honest, like a book a year. Okay. I need to qualify this, when I say one book a year,

I'm just meaning one book for pleasure. Simply not for work or skimming self-help books

How [stumbles] How long are you gonna live? My oldest grandparents lived till about like 90. So you have 55 years left.

So, let's just look at this here

All right.

Okay, it's a book

So this is the book that you're gonna read this year, okay, and this is the book you're gonna read next year and

this is the book that you might not finish because you're gonna die while reading this book here.

Okay, this shelf here, up here, is

about 55 books

This is all the books you're ever gonna read again, this is it.

I wish I had read more books.

Let's just figure out how fast you're reading. I want you to read from here to that dot.

Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins, my sin, my soul.

Lolita

For tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap at three on the teeth

Lo-Li-Ta

Okay

Okay, six minutes and 27 seconds. -

It felt like eternity. Okay so, you read

about 1550 words in 6 minutes 27 seconds 397 this worked out really nicely. You read a book in about ten hours.

Somehow I feel like you don't, but I'll give it to you. You were racing there. You were timing but look I mean

let's just give you the benefit of the doubt.

Sleep is good, but books are better

George R. R. Martin

Okay, you're awake about sixteen hours a day. That's thirty two half hours a day it's kind of allowing

you thirty two half hours, right currently at one point six four minutes a day

this is this is what Max allots to reading now, but if you allotted

one of these of every day to reading, you will become a major reader who'll read a thousand books instead of fifty-five.

Wait a minute. To read nine hundred and forty five more books before I die

all I need to do is read 30 minutes a day. Someone will be like, "Oh my grandfather. He's this great reader

He's read everything." That's you versus being like,

"Yeah, my grandfather literally has not read anything ever." The secret of the people who were like, "Yeah,

here are my 10 favorite books of 2016." and you're just like how do they...

It's... They just do this and you don't. Tim was giving me new

hope. Maybe there was a way to overcome my book anxiety after all.

You wake up in the morning and you flip on an audio book while you're brushing your teeth and making breakfast.

Done. That's it. You've done your thirty minutes

If you read for two hours every Saturday, you like to wake up in the morning and you have a Saturday session in a coffee

shop reading. You've just done four sevenths of your week.

It's very inspiring when you realize how easy you can read a thousand, and this is at your slow ass reading rate.

This also just speaks to the power of habits, because if you have the right habit,

that's a breeze.

If you don't have the right habit, you'll do it four days in a row, and then you'll take 40 days off.

At 30 minutes a day. Only.

you can read this,

and War and Peace,

and Moby Dick,

and three other books.

Okay

We are now heading to Europe, to Brussels first actually, to see one of the most amazing bookstores in the world.

First stop: Brussels.

A city famous for beer, chocolate, Tintin,  the EU and now a bookstore on the city's outskirts called

Cook & Book.

Okay, so I am here at Cook & Book

It doesn't look like much from the outside, but look at the size of this place.

It's spread out across one, two, three, four, five six, seven eight buildings

Cook & Books' nine different libraries include the literature room,

The English bookstore,

Travel,

Fine Arts,

comics and graphic novels,

Music,

Oh and then there's the home and garden room, the cookbook room and the children's bookstore.

It's like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory but the bookstore version

Okay, well today has gotten off to somewhat of a rough start

I had wanted to leave

Brussels at 11 but I woke up at around 11:30

It's now one

The book store closes at 6:00

And I'm renting a car to drive to Maastricht, which should only be about an hour and a half, we've got the rental car

Okay, here we go the great European driving experiment.

I think I got it. I'm on the wrong side of the road already.

It's a church. Dominican church and it's empty for almost 200 years.

We celebrate carnival in it, it has Christmas markets in it, Napoleon's stored his horse and carriages over here

Different things.

My favorite story about the church is that it housed the local guillotine in the 19th century.

Indiana Jones.

I like these books.

Do you read a lot of books? Yes. 50 to 60 books in a year. 50 to 60 books a year?

Yes. That's a lot of books. That's a lot of books, yeah. A lot of reading. Do you watch TV?

Little, just little yeah, not much. Yes

I hope I will be able to confide everything to you as I have never been able to confide in anyone

And I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support

How do you make time for all those books?

I go to bed to bed early and make time to read. Yes. How many... how many hours a day would you say you read?

One to two hours. Yes. Depends how tired I am.

Thank you so much.You're welcome. I really appreciate it

Bye.

I like big books and I cannot lie.

I think that I'm over doing it with news. I gorge myself on news.

So you said you read the news

about 20 minutes a day and you're on social media another 30

50 minutes a day of those things adds up to three hundred and four hours a year

Which would be, at your rate, over 30 books. So you're saying there's a 30 bookshelf that is filled...

With news and social media.

Right now what we're doing is we're taking a 30 book shelf that you are reading every year and we're taking 17 of the News and

social media books out and

We're putting in 17 new books

There's a blog called Barking Up the Wrong Tree by a guy named Eric Barker

and

His blog is super popular, it's great and

It's about, you know, for his... in order to write he needs to read one or two

Even three things just to write one post. He doesn't post every week. So he must read fifty maybe a hundred books a year

He has some magical secret. I don't know what it is, but

You're trying to go to 18 if he's reading 50 or 100. That's a whole different thing

and again, you know he has he does other things with his time, so I didn't know what

His secret is but you should talk to him

My name is Eric Barker and I'm an addict.

This is Eric Barker. Over the last 10 years

he's become one of the most popular writers on the internet with his blog "Barking up the Wrong Tree" now available in best-selling book form.

His posts like "Six Hostage Negotiation Techniques That Will Get You What You Want"

and "how to make your life better by sending five simple emails"

Draw from cutting-edge findings in science and human behavior to distill clear and simple life hacks

Like talking to yourself using the word you "you can do it", "you're the best" is actually more effective than using the word I.

I can't. I suck.

For each post he does a ton of research including reading multiple books and journals and conducting long interviews

And he's posting one a week. So how do you do it? What's your process?

How do you get through so much material? On my phone. I don't have Facebook. I don't have Twitter. I don't have email

My instinct to check social media, I've redirected towards the Kindle app

I give myself three checks a day unless there's an explicit reason when I know an important emails coming in

So it's like, you can check everything now. Facebook, Twitter, Email. Get it all done

but anytime I have that urge to check, you know, I pause for a second and I'm like

Is there a good reason for this? And if not, I redirect that towards towards reading a blog

Yet habit strange thing what cannot have it accomplished?

Do you read on your iPhone? Most of my reading takes place on my iPad where it's it's really

Is it iPad or Kindle?

It's the Kindle app on the iPad

Interesting.

This also just speaks to the power of habits because changing a habit is like

Overriding your current software and if you do it enough times

What's cool about your brain, is it rewrites it to accommodate the new behavior you're saying?

Oh

I guess we're doing this everyday now. In his book, The Power of Habit

Charles Duhigg says habits emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. When an action becomes a habit

It actually moves to a different part of the brain. You see decision making and willpower take place in the prefrontal cortex

That's prime real estate when we turn an action into a habit

It migrates to the basal ganglia and therefore frees up space in the prefrontal cortex

for other more important decisions

There's one expert in terms of habit formation BJ Fogg at Stanford and I love this one principle

He uses it's called minimum viable effort

When you're trying to build a habit, he says the key thing is consistency, because if it's not consistent, it's not a habit

So minimum viable effort you want to start flossing more? Okay, floss one tooth

Just floss one tooth. Make it so simple that you can't not do it

I'm gonna read one page. It's so simple. I can't not do it. I'd feel like an idiot

once you can do that for like two weeks straight great two pages.

As opposed to setting this crazy high goal, failing, feeling bad, not wanting to do it

Now you've got a Pavlovian association where it's like, oh, I tried that it didn't work

I don't feel good. In discussing helpful ways to build a habit, Duhigg talks a lot about

rewards like giving yourself a piece of chocolate,

or in my case a mini Cinnabon, every time you perform a desired habit

The difference between the thousand book reader and the 55 book reader in their lifetimes isn't really much

It's one has the right habit and the other one doesn't have the right habit

Rigid the skeleton of habits alone upholds the human frame

Do you read one book at a time?

Or do you read like five books at once?

I read multiple books at once and especially, you know, when you're when you're starting out, you know, try and build that habit

totally read multiple books because once again you you kind of want that you want that you wanna be excited and

At least at first, you know, it's like if it if you're excited about something and then it doesn't pan out

You're not so much fine. The most important thing is you want to keep reading you want to build that reading habit

So if it turns into a slog put it aside take the next one because first and foremost just make sure you're enjoying it

What I kept hearing him say was: allow yourself to fall in love

It's okay to date a lot of books at the beginning before you really make a connection with one

But then once you do throw yourself in full bore

maybe if I only focused on how excited I was to read my current book so much so that I just read it at every

Free moment I had: on the subway, in an uber or times I'd just be mindlessly checking social media

I mean if I did all that I could surely make a habit of reading 30 minutes a day

Couldn't I?

It's also worth noting that on Eric's blog he explains another good hack to forming a habit is using friends to hold you accountable

I  will read "Infinite Jest" with you. I will have a book club

So we're going to do "Infinite Jest?"

I'm gonna start this it seems even as I say that I'm like there's no way I could ever read this

It is

Just like 9:15 in Porto Portugal. We're going over now to

Livraria Lello,  bookstore Lello. Oh my god. There's a huge line to get into this place

What's interesting about Lello is that they actually make you buy a ticket for four Euros

but those four euros are against any book that you might buy in there

It's like Wimbledon over here

Are there always this many people here? Yes every day

We're talking about a million a year, which is 3,000 a day.

It's the most authentic Harry Potter universe that actually exists.

That's my going theory.

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number 4 Privet Drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal

Thank you very much, JK Rowling

Apparently lived in Porto. She was married with someone here and she used to come here and write

Where you were upstairs before we used to have a cafe

It was a very quiet place like most bookstores

And she was so overwhelmed with the beauty of it so she would come and sit down and write here

and

They say she got inspired by a lot of the details

We've got here the stairs for example

The fluidity. "Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward like an escalator"

She took things from town from the fountain next door from the students wearing black: "First year

Students will require three sets of plain work robes, black." Most people come here thinking

That the movie was actually filmed here

Hi everyone, I'm Howard Berg the world's fastest reader

I'm here today to share with you some of the strategies that helped me get into the Guinness Book of World Records

So let's get started. We have  Howard Berg with us this morning

He is the world's fastest reader. The world's fastest reader Howard Berg is wrapping up Max Baucus'

Health Care Bill. I'm the world's fastest reader

I can read around 80 pages a minute this

supersonic speed put Howard in the Guinness Book of World

Records and on the road teaching others his skill not a magic trick

It is a skill and it's something people can learn. That's my whole point of doing this

I'm going to show you how to increase your reading speed. I'm gonna show you why you read slowly

I'm gonna show you how to improve your comprehension, which I think is far more important than your speed

In fact before we're done today, I'll show you the meaning of life. If you'd like that. I'll show you. Yeah, that's it

Howard is the fastest reader in the world, so I asked him to teach me his world-famous speed reading technique

Are you from New York? I?

Thought so, I heard a little of that

Twang I figured if I could up my pages per minute. Then I could easily read more books before I died. Okay?

To start speeding up

You're gonna take your hand and you're gonna go one line at a time

With your hand going from the left to the right margin from the left to the right margin with your eyes

Following your hand you go one line at a time all the way across eye following the hand

Eye following the hand and here's the secret sauce as fast as you could comprehend and just doing that one change

Will bump you up by 10 to 20 percent

Like just just doing this line by line as fast as you could comprehend not that's right

They told you a lot of things in school that were wrong what they did when they taught reading is they had you read aloud?

It's like someone's in back or your head pronouncing one word at a time

When I'm reading 80-90 pages a minute, I'm seeing movies and then when I want to remember what I read

I play the movie back and I'm seeing the details in my movie and I'm converting what I'm seeing back to sound

So we're gonna learn a Paul Revere, but we're going to use the senses and not just the way we normally would learn it

So I'm gonna show you how to do this. So Paul Revere

He stood near Boston Harbor and he smelled and tasted salt. Okay, I want you to smell and taste the salt

He saw that bite to tower see the light in the tower one light by land

So you're having me

Experience it

He mounted his horse. He felt the saddle pressing against him you feel the saddle. Mm-hmm

he started a ride and on the cobblestones he heard the

And then he got in the woods this is what you mean by

Hear it feel it smell it touch it taste it

Experience it and he heard the hooves on the soft ground

and

He could smell the pine trees in the woods

And a textbook it would have said Paul Revere warned the regulars the Minutemen were coming, you know next day

well, you'd remember as I read something about the Revolutionary War, but if you

Experienced it. You smell the smells. You heard the hooves you felt the saddle

now all of your brain is engaged

It's immersive. You're experiencing it as if it's happening

Tell me when you're ready right go

What's happening is the part of your brain that listens to the words won't be able to keep up it's like this isn't working

I can't read like this and I want that to happen because then there's only one place in your brain

which can process the data at that speed because of the stress and

because of the confusion the part of your brain that makes movies switches on and

Then you are reading faster and you do know what you're reading

Stop. Now look at where you are compared to where you were the first time. You're about 10-20% faster

Yeah, okay. That's how easy this is

I am in Lisbon Portugal and I'm heading right now to the world famous Ler Devagar bookstore

They're opening up a little early for me because I wanted to fly a drone inside the store

Manuel, nice to meet you. Okay, this is Manuel. He had the best drone footage of Lisbon on YouTube when I searched yesterday

How old are you?

I'm 17. -You're 17? Amazing!

He and his assistant Nuno, also 17, are here to help me shoot this

All right, well we're already having some problems with the drone Manuel is sweating over here

Come on! Get it up!

We have a bookshop, but we have also a restaurant, a patisserie, a bar, a gallery

What does Ler Devagar mean? Ler Devagar means read slowly

Because

All things that we do we must do slowly or with time

If I can only go to one other book shop in Portugal which one should it be?

Outside Lisbon Lello in Porto

Akivo in Lyria

Fonta Lettras in Evora and all book shops in Obidos.

In where? - Obidos

That town is a whole bookstore town, yes. Yes, there are

Fourteen bookshops and the habitants in the center of the city are sixty-two!

62 inhabitants and 14 bookshops

It was my last day in Portugal and I didn't really have a lot of time

So I rushed up to Obidos and tried to see as many bookstores as I could before everything closed

This one's in a church

This one sells fresh produce

The bookstore that's in the church just told me about another bookstore that's amazing

That's like a labyrinth of books, but it closes in like five minutes

My search for beautiful bookstores is starting to make me as anxious as my reading problem, I'm literally

Inside of a dark maze of books right now. There was so much to see but just not enough time and

There's like some

Chocolaty saying dripping from the ceiling

If this is not a living metaphor, I don't know what is

I'm standing in the literary man hotel and

It is the most amazing hotel I've ever seen in my entire life

But I

Can't possibly film any more today right now. I'm recording this on my cell phone because all my other cameras the batteries are dead

Because I've been shooting all day

Look at this place

I have to come back, I mean that's that's just it I have to come back here

The train is approaching Terminal B

All right, we are here now in Prairie View, Texas

Well actually is Prairie View the name of the place?

It is okay

Right here okay, do you prefer to sit or stand?

I can sit

Dr. Ruth J. Simmons is a total baller

Born the youngest of 12 children to a sharecropper family in Texas

Ruth became the first African American woman to head an Ivy League university

When she became president of Brown in 2001

She's also a world-class scholar in comparative literature and still teaches many courses on the topic to this day

So I figured she'd be the perfect person to tell me what books we should be reading in our limited time

I'm much less

convinced than many others that there is a

prescriptive list of books that you must read

I'm more convinced that it is the reading widely that matters more than anything else not

somebody a list of things that people have said these are the things to read, no.

I don't buy that at all

I know a lot of people today like to do things on the fly

You can't read a book on the fly

Thank goodness, right?

Because

Forced

Meditation it's probably a good thing

Is that what you feel books are, forced meditation? -They can enable it if you're not disciplined enough to meditate otherwise

I remember that, you know Brown students would come and they'd show me their schedule and you know

Everything is so laid out and they're very intense

about it and they've got to do this and then they've got to do that and so forth and I always always

Say to them. I want to see you sitting on the green

with a book

stop

Reflect

If you don't do that you are a lesser human being for sure for sure

The busyness does not make our lives meaningful

It is the interior life that makes the greatest difference to us in the end

Maybe the whole purpose of reading wasn't to learn more

But to get in touch with that deep and quiet part of yourself

Your inner temple so to speak

if you

enforce reading

You're likely to enforce time

for reflection

Because it's hard to read without reflecting

This reminded me of something Howard Berg said

I don't start off with that speed

It's as slow as I want

I've learned to shut it off when I want to. If I'm relaxing and I'm reading and I'm enjoying something

Do you want to read let's say you're a Harry Potter fan and you waited ten months for the next book

Do you want to finish in three minutes?

It's like chugging down Perignon  or looking at the Mona Lisa on a skateboard. You you don't get the ambiance the flavor

Well, if the fastest reader in the world likes to slow down when he reads

Maybe I should too

The last stop on this journey : Buenos Aires

Okay, today is the day

I'm going to the number one most beautiful bookstore in the world at least according to the internet.

Finally made it to the promised land. Now I just need to go in and film it

El Teatro Grand Splendid started as a tango theater in 1919 and then became a movie theater in 1929

And eventually a bookstore in 2000

These bookstores are like temples

Some of them have even been churches

A place to get in touch with your higher-self

And nourish your soul

There's something about being in a bookstore that makes you feel infinite like you can touch the magic

And when I look at it that way it doesn't make me so anxious

Alright well that just about does it

I've seen almost all the most beautiful bookstores in

Europe North America and South America

At some point. I'll have to make a volume two in

Russia and Asia and Australia, but until then I think this will have to do

On the way to the airport I reflected on what this journey was really about

What reading is really about?

When we read we are transported to another

Another space another seat, you lose yourself. You forget everything that's happening outside

It is the most amazing thing

You can fly when we read a book, but it only works if you slow down enough to hear the hooves

experiencing. To get to that quiet place inside yourself where you're reflecting

and build a habit out of it

Just 30 minutes a day or three hours a week

With all the ways you can read now. There's almost no excuse

forced

meditation

Is probably a good thing and the best part about it is that it should be fun

First and foremost just make sure you're enjoying it unlike the gym

This is not a bad square this one your favorite rectangles of the day and the meaning of life

Well Howard still needs to explain that one to me. It's not hidden

it's in plain sight but it's scattered to thousands and

Thousands and thousands and thousands of books and art and music the pieces of the puzzle are all out there

So Tim it's been literally

Maybe a year. Yeah, since we met yeah, how are you doing

with "Infinite Jest"?

-"Hmmm..."
