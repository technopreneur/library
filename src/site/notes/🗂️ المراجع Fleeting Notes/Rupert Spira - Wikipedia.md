**Rupert Spira** [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Spira#cite_note-1) (1960) is an [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England") [spiritual teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_teacher "Spiritual teacher"), philosopher and [author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author "Author") of the Direct Path[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Spira#cite_note-2) based in [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford "Oxford"), UK.

## Life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rupert_Spira&action=edit&section=1&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro "Edit section: Life")\]

Just prior to beginning his formal spiritual exploration, Spira attended an exhibition by the studio potter [Michael Cardew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cardew "Michael Cardew") at Camberwell Arts Centre in London.\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\] Spira’s encounter with the arts and spiritual traditions inspired him to abandon the scientific path he was on and begin his art studies with Henry Hammond at [West Surrey College of Art and Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Surrey_College_of_Art_and_Design "West Surrey College of Art and Design") in 1997 and take an apprenticeship with [Michael Cardew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cardew "Michael Cardew"), then aged eighty, at [Wenford Bridge Pottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenford_Bridge_Pottery "Wenford Bridge Pottery") from 1980 to 1982.  Spira graduated from [West Surrey College of Art and Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Surrey_College_of_Art_and_Design "West Surrey College of Art and Design") with a BA in 1983.

In 1984, Spira opened his own studio at Lower Froyle in [Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire "Hampshire"), then moved his studio to [Shropshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shropshire "Shropshire") in 1996. Spira’s pieces can be found in private and public collections around the world.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Spira#cite_note-3)\[*[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*\]

## Career as a potter\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rupert_Spira&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro "Edit section: Career as a potter")\]

Spira's early [wheel-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter%27s_wheel "Potter's wheel") pottery work reflected these early influences being in a very traditional [Bernard Leach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Leach "Bernard Leach") utilitarian style. This work is mostly practical in nature, taking the form of [teapots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teapot "Teapot"), vases, vessels, plates and other culinary ware.

In 1996, he set up his own pottery at Church Farm in [Shropshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shropshire "Shropshire") where his style changed from a functional to a more minimalist, finer, more complex style ranging in size from miniature to large-scale. While he continues to make and sell functional pottery he is now known for this more recent [studio pottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_pottery "Studio pottery"). His best and most recognizable work contains poems, both self-written and by [Kathleen Raine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Raine "Kathleen Raine") the celebrated British poet. The poems are either scratched into the glaze in the [sgraffito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgraffito "Sgraffito") style or written as embossed letters either in a square block or in a single line across the surface of the vessel.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Spira#cite_note-scva.org.uk-4) These works vary in size from small prayer bowls only a few centimetres across through to huge, open bowls 50 cm or more in diameter. He is also known for his cylinders which are often made as part of a series and while each stands alone, are meant to be exhibited as a group. These also vary in scale from a few centimetres high through to the largest being a meter or more tall. He works in a limited palette, mainly simple white, off-white and black monochromes but he does also occasionally make deep, red-glazed bowls and bright yellow tea sets.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Spira#cite_note-Widewalls-5)

## Career as a spiritual teacher\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rupert_Spira&action=edit&section=3&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro "Edit section: Career as a spiritual teacher")\]

Spira's considers that his spiritual journey started on reading the poetry of Rumi at age fifteen. Following in his parents' footsteps,[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Spira#cite_note-6) he studied at [Colet House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Study_Society "The Study Society"), London under Dr Francis Roles, himself a student of mystic-philosophers [Ouspensky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._D._Ouspensky "P. D. Ouspensky") and [Gurdjieff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gurdjieff "George Gurdjieff") and the mantra meditation of [Swami Shantananda Saraswati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantanand_Saraswati "Shantanand Saraswati"). This also led him to an interest in classical [Advaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta "Advaita Vedanta") (non-duality) while he also continued to investigate Sufism through the art of [Mevlevi Turning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi_whirling "Sufi whirling"), a form of sacred movement combining prayer and meditation. He also read teachings of [Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisargadatta_Maharaj "Nisargadatta Maharaj") and [Ramana Maharshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi "Ramana Maharshi") and, in the late 1970s he attended Krishnamurti’s last meetings at Brockwood Park.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Spira#cite_note-7)

In the mid-1990s meetings with [Robert Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Adams_(spiritual_teacher) "Robert Adams (spiritual teacher)") and Francis Lucille led Spira to the Direct Path teachings of [Atmananda Krishna Menon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmananda_Krishna_Menon "Atmananda Krishna Menon") which forms the basis of his own 'no-nonsense' Direct Path approach to spiritual awakening.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Spira#cite_note-8)

In essence Spira teaches that ‘The greatest discovery in life is that our essential nature does not share the limits or the destiny of the body and mind'.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Spira#cite_note-9) He suggests that a form of happiness, a satisfying if unexotic 'enlightenment', can be found if one can identify with the I that lies behind the imagined I of feelings and thoughts.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Spira#cite_note-10)
