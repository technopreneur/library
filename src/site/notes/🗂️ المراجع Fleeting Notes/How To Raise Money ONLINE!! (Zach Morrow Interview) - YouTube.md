everybody welcome back to investment fun secret so today we've got my good friend on here mr. Zack morrow fantastic guy you've already heard his intro long list of a crazy career in the Marines working the White House will probably dive into all that but now runs a super successful fund they're anticipating doing about a hundred million dollars of transactions in the next this year the next 12 months which is just incredible we're excited to have Zack on we might even split this into two different segments because I

think we're getting a lot of content out of here but anyways Zack welcome to the show how you doing what's going on Bridger glad to be here man yeah this is gonna be fun to have you actually so Zack came through you had listened to the podcast first or saw like an ad of me or something yeah I saw your ad on Facebook and you DM me we met up a couple weeks ago in Nashville it turns out Zack runs an incredible fun with this partner and we're gonna dive into all this but I said Zack you got to come on and talk to people how you raise a

lot of money in the past had really unique ways of raising money and thinking about pitching investors you've done a lot of raising money online through online marketing and expert through building out funnels and AD stuff like that I know a lot of people DM me and ask me about raising money not just from word-of-mouth right really by advertising and doing a you know 506 C filings or regulation a filings where you can actually advertise and so here's we're gonna dive in all that in this episode so really fun so Zack though

going back to the beginning tell us your story how did you get started tell us all about that yeah so as you mentioned years ago I was actually on a marine presidential security force worked for a top-secret facility Department of the White House worked in matters of national security every single day and four to seven presidents and you know Bridger you talk about allowing your future to be dictated by the decisions you make today and that's a principle that it's very important to me as well coming out of

the Marine Corps I learned a lot of things that I liked and more importantly I think at the time I learned a lot of things I did not like and so as I was setting forth for the course the rest of my life at the time you know I'm a father I'm married and a a little baby girl right and I'm coming out and I'm trying to set up a structure for the rest of my life it'll would allow me to live a life of in legacy one where I could not only control my future but also be in a position to create the income and impact

that I knew that is important for each of us in our lives so I think everybody is getting connected to you Bridger is realizing that there's greater opportunity out there I was in search for that opportunity and so coming out the Marine Corps I started to my own businesses and I started learning how to grow and scale a business some things obviously I was learning the hard way couple years in a business I met somebody named Blake Templeton and what are you doing right now are these just these aren't investment businesses right

these were not investment businesses and so at the time I met Blake and Blake actually had started and was running his own private investment firm many years earlier he started back in 2006 which subsequently is boron capital born capital is who I'm with now right so Blake and I started doing some business together and he ultimately came friend mentor and we started doing business consulting we were growing my businesses and then I eventually sold all of my businesses and came over full-time to the team here at boron Capital so my

background was not exclusively in investments or investment funds my background was in investment business understanding business communications leadership and actually how to work with people in such a way that you could produce an impact in their life and so it's funny just like you talked about all the time I don't have the Harvard MBA you know I don't have the Harvard finance degree that brought me to this position I came up a little bit through the school of hard knocks and did some on-the-job training and learn from

mentors and people before me of how to grow and scale and so it's been an internal search that's driven me to become the best and so it's my passing and competitive spirit and drive is what's led me to be here today and it's that relentless effort that I would encourage and I'm sure everybody listening to this podcast actually has to get there so wherever you're at that's the recipe right so I love it so so you blade what year did you meet Blake so he started in 2006 when did you meet him I

think we met in 2014 originally okay 2014 so then so what like and for people watching this you don't need to see the guy that starts the fund you can come on later and join up like you've done with Blake and be very successful doing that so what when you approach flake or Blake approached you how did that happen and why did he what what drew you in like what right you're just like hey I've got a couple businesses I was in the marine I worked in the White House for a while like hey now can you raise money for me right and

what's the connection from those two and how did you and Blake become partners yeah so originally again he was doing business consulting for my businesses so we've been doing business together for quite some time and as things were growing and scaling on his firm side we started doing more things together and then it became a relationship where I was coming over and helping on some things and eventually you know I remember we were actually at a conference working a conference down in New Orleans and I was helping with some

structuring we're doing some business development really like meeting with investors and things like that and I remember we were sitting across the table from each other and you just looked at me and he's like what do you think about doing this full-time I'm like what do you mean what are you talking about he's like what do you think about doing this full-time coming over you know running in a VP position here and coming alongside of us at the firm and you know obviously they became you know more extended conversation but

for me it was a reality that sometimes in life you're going to hit a point where you realize that you don't have the right scale in your current lane to get where you want to get so that was really the idea is that the businesses I were creating did not have the same scalability and didn't offer the same upside potential that being in a fund has and so wherever you're at it if you're a person that knows you want to live for a purpose bigger than yourself if you are a person that wants impact

you got to make sure that the vehicle you're in can take you there and so my realization was that what I was creating was not going to take me there and was gonna slow me down so ultimately led me to the decision of selling my businesses and coming on over here full-time with more on capital it's been an exciting adventure ever since oh I love that let me talk about vehicles as well about I figure any a fun this investment vehicle is it's it's the vehicle that can take you to the most wealth possible

in America maybe this and like running your own like tech company right I think those two vehicles the most wealthiest people come out of those vehicles right and I love what you said about if you want to make impact and change the world like you got to be in a good vehicle I love that so okay so you guys team-up 2014 ish right a couple years after yeah couple years after UK you're actually officially on yeah and what what were you guys investing in at that time and what are you doing now what was kind of

a bore on capita what are you guys doing there yeah so at born we got a couple beliefs okay we've got a couple core principles that gauge everything that we do okay and what I would tell you is it starts with three seats we're looking for cash flow we're looking for collateral and we're looking for control okay here's my encouragement to all of you who are setting up funds and also all of you who are looking to invest in funds you should be investing in places you can mitigate risk now the only way

you can mitigate risk is to control the variables but the only way you can control the variables is if you own the investments so I encourage everyone to consider the control aspect of where they're investing and also consider that to look where you're investing or how you're investing so we're looking for control so we're what what people in the industry would call vertically integrated and our core we're always going to have collateral we're gonna have commercial real estate we're gonna

have real tangible asset okay it provides collateral for us in our investors and then we're going to be vertically integrated which means we're owning the operational arm of that investment property right so we have a couple niches of business that we operate in and we're going to actually operate a business on site that gives us the ability to not only have collateral to protect their money but when we own the business side it allows us to increase profits and actually better control over the profit margins

to increase the bottom dollar you're not hoping somebody else runs it well you're gonna make sure it runs runs what I love that correct yeah yeah so with anything there's pros and cons but we think of everything in the long term and we're looking at how we can grow and scale with control that allows us to have a successful track record so in 14 years of business right praise the Lord no investors lost money and we believe that it is these principles that has allowed us to do that because we set up

those risk mitigation factors but we also set ourselves up in a position to leverage our ability to increase profits I love that I love you mentioned about the control factor I've heard this from multiple fund managers is that it's not X's and O's it's not high-risk high-reward low-risk low reward there are there's a factor of control in there that you where you find that alpha yeah you can have high returns with relatively low risk if you do the three things you just mentioned I love those

so much that's awesome sound it looks like you guys have done very well in your firm and have grown very quick that's why I wanted to bring you on or a great example of what's happened so congrats to you guys at boron you shaved that so now looking forward your main role there you do a lot of strategic planning and then also a lot of I would just call it money raising in the most basic terms right going out finding investors raising the money bringing in the dollars so I want to hear from from the horse's mouth from

you how do you raise money effectively what's your strategy when you say have we got to raise 10 million dollars or 20 or 30 million dollars just starting out how do you go about it and then I'm gonna fall ask a ton of follow-up questions about walking into the process of how you raise your sure as Berger mentioned what I do is I set up the ecosystem that allows investors to get connected to what it is we're doing okay I don't think of it just as capital raising you have to set up a system that

allows people to get to know you understand who you are and what you're doing before you ever get in front of them I would encourage everyone to start processing how can your reputation precedes you walk into a meeting or you walk into a room people understand what it is you're there for and what it is you you and so I would say this investors invest first in people so if they don't know you it's gonna be very difficult to close in any amount of time or for any dollar amount right because the first

thing they're looking at is who are you the second thing they're looking at is track record and the third thing they're looking at is the actual deal and you'll never actually get to the deal presentation if they don't first have a base or a foundation in agreement with who you are as a person and what your track record is and that is that what you mean by ecosystem by the way when you mention equals is if that was the kind of three things you're looking at right that's what you were said yeah

okay people first how do you let them get to know you how do you let them see your track record and then how do you get a deal in front of them I want people to know us to know our track record before I ever asked for them to join us okay so how do you do that just understand this principle 80% of all decisions are made before people ever get on the phone with you so when they get on the phone with you they're already leaning 80% in one direction okay and that's just on the phone call right so how do you create it

to where there's relationship prior to interaction what we do is we start processing from a marketing standpoint now depending on how everybody's structuring their funds your marketing abilities are going to be low your marketing abilities are low if you're not structured perfectly so structurally for us yeah we operate under Regulation D 506 C primarily so within if I will succeed we can mark it publicly and we can speak to accredited investors okay so we we put out consistent content and we have a whole marketing team that

allows us to engage with our users these the the person that you're asking for money if these people have millions of dollars to spend their time is extremely expensive and so they have to value what they're spending time on if they're gonna spend time on it so we want to actually give them the ability to engage with us on their own time prior to us ever speaking with them so what we do is we have marketing systems that deploy out videos that allow them to get to know about us and what we do then we

have retargeting which means if they're engaging with us they're getting to see more and more content from us so setting up an ecosystem of content that allows people to understand who you are what your beliefs are how you invest what your track record is how do we get all of that out of the way before we ever get on the phone then how do we actually get them on the phone we do that by setting up a system where we can already help them make up their mind and know they want to spend time with you before

you ever actually have that first interaction and so we focus a lot on that front end I love this and this is what I mean we first started chatting about I just thought this is the coolest thing ever that you guys have effectively figured out a really cool way to find investors through online content marketing ads stuff like that mm-hmm and what you just mentioned I love to is you retarget them and are trying to help them on their own time yep trust and like you before it because that eight I love that principle of 80% the decisions

happen before the phone call so what are a few things do you make sure to include on those videos to help maybe break down some of their false beliefs help them trust you more what are a few things you make sure to include on those those pieces of marketing material okay great before you ever put it out a single piece of content you need to understand exactly who it is you're trying to market to so the whoo yeah whoo who are you speaking to right for us majority of the funds or investments we do are gonna

be with individual credit investors right if you're going after family offices private equity if you're trying to bring on other funds or investment groups it's a different process so this is not necessarily the exact formula for those guys now do you need a reputation before you ever get with them 100% right but understanding who you're speaking to is of the utmost importance are you are you running a stock base fund are you doing certain types of tre are you doing hard money loans are you doing actual acquisitions and then

running the business operations like we are are you going out and flipping properties everything's relative you got to know who your person is so the first thing I would tell you is that understanding who they are understand where are their pain points and what are their desires so the first thing people want to know at least our front end is we're trying to create what we'd call status alignment we want them to understand that we are one of them we want them to understand that we're of the same value level in terms of this

relationship and we're going to be a valuable resource for them so they need to understand that they're gonna get value by spending time with us the old ways of rapport don't create status alignment right just because you're from the same hometown that might give you something to kind of oh hey that's awesome but if they don't understand that you're in the same league or a league above them when it comes to this specific thing it's not gonna be valuable for them in this lane so status

alignments the first thing we're going for and give you a quick example it's like you're at a bar right and maybe you know everything there is to know about having a certain style of drink well if you ask the bartender for a very specific drink that nobody else knows about all of a sudden they know you're that type of person and you go into the investment world if they can't see sound investing principles and fundamentals coming out very very quickly and understand that you are an expert at

your craft then it's not worth their time and want to be with other experts so status limits the first thing we're looking for and then we try to call out our audience right we want them to know we're talking to them so we're gonna have videos you'll target like a credit investors hey like are you doing that calling them out specifically right there in certain videos yes I'll have a video right now we pulled it from a podcast and for those of you who are numbers geeks 50% of people bridger I

know you guys do some some online marketing as well so you'll get this 50% of the people that watch this video are finishing the entire thing and the exact video is what is an accredited so we pulled a clip from a podcast where it's me just saying let's just break this down right now who isn't a credit investor this is what it is and people are watching that all the way through and by the end of the video they're actually knowing like I'm that person this content is for me and they know

that we're the authority or the expert in that topic because we're giving them the exacts we're giving those definitive 'z to them yeah I gotcha okay so you've done it you mentioned kind of being at the same level as them right your understanding your who the person you're targeting having the same status as them calling them out then what's next what do you guys do next so then it's a lot of nurturing we're providing more of that content we want people to get the feeling of omnipresence so it's it's

sending more videos their way all of which that is relevant commentary on what is important to them inside this space so it's relative commentary on the financial markets relative commentary on what makes sense in 2020 for this type of investment style what makes sense right now investors in 2020 allocation needs to look like X Y Z because of X Y Z so it's giving them relative commentary on market and market conditions now at this point is there any like opt-in like hey if you want to learn more come here if you want to

invest come here have you done any of that yet are you waiting to do that so until they've cycled through a handful of videos we don't have hard call to actions we will drop links inside the comment section and things like that so they could connect with us but we don't do any hard closes and once people have spent time circulating there will actually pull them over and target them with more specific call to actions where it's getting them on an investor presentation it's sending them to a full

webinar on a specific offering or it's driving them into the back end to review to review our current offerings things of that nature so we're not really asking for anything from them until we know they're very interested in our product we're trying to create again remember people track record then deal when you mention sending them more videos I think some people watching this and we do some online marketing right you talk about being on omnipresent yeah I've met people that bridged you oh my

gosh I see like 40 of your videos a day right and I'm like I'm so sorry about that but we we only do that to like a certain small group of our little you know to other people we don't even send our videos to right that's a cool you know cool feature with Facebook marketing Google online marketing in general essentially with ads is if somebody is interested in your ad or has watched it for 50 percent or hundreds in you can retarget them super easily and then it feels like oh my gosh boron capitals everywhere oh my gosh

these guys must be crushing it right I see oh my gosh I see him everywhere and it's like no yeah they're doing well but just to you we've been doing that right you become omnipresent in their mind and kind of fill up their minds because I think that's a really cool concept that you brought up of the omnipresence to that potential investor or potential potential person you're trying to to get your to your firm I love that yeah I would tell you that investors need to see activity activity creates track

record as well so you can do it the hard way by calling them once a month for the next three years right and our strong arm and your way in there but relationship takes time so how can you create relationship prior to you ever spending time with them it not only frees up your time but it allows you to collapse the cycle I would tell you that money is truly measured more in time than it is dollars right so money as far as dollars go you need to increase dollars of course but the faster you can bring money to the table the better so

always asking the question of how can you collapse time how can you collapse time how can we increase the speed of relationship how can we increase the speed of trust how do we let them get to know us quickly so that we can have a real conversation I love it so okay so you've done the retargeting you've got them warmed up they've nurtured them through your content you've done that you know all the three steps you've been going through so far so what's next once you have that call to action what

happens then they you hop on the phone with them then do they I cuz in a Regulation D 506 C fund which you guys are doing mm-hm can't advertise but you have to verify all of your investors are accredited investors now have a check kind of a checklist you guys have to get w-2s like you have to really like verify that it's no six B they just have to check a box that's kind of one of the big drawbacks of a 506 C so how do you get a what sorry I'm gassing a lot of questions here but what's next in the

process how do you validate their credit investors and then getting on the phone with you and closing them walk us through that so so it's just important to understand that nobody could ever invest with us unless everything has been verified and it's the same in a B actually be the drawbacks of B is that you can't advertise and a B you have to actually have a pre-existing relationship so you can't advertise and bring people in you got to spend time creating a relationship beforehand so we focus on relationship anyways because

it's the right way to do things you want people to know exactly who you are what you're doing and be excited about being a part of your deal right being a part of your fund or your offering or whatever it is so with the C we actually have them opt in so but with their gonna opt in to something whether it be we've got you know ebooks they can download we've got you know webinars that go out is we're telling them this is for credit investors only and they're having to mark their having to verify yes I'm a

credit investor before they can actually even get the content and then once they go to content you know they can they can see the content but then it comes down to verification has to happen so if I'm on the phone with them it's it's letting them know hey you've already checked this we just want to verify you understand what a credit investor is you understand this definition yes you are no you're not right yeah and then of course once you go through the pitch then then you still have to verify right

there's processes that have to take place you're going through verification questionnaires they're having to get you know signed off by either legal or CPA or bringing in w-2s or you know verifying our net worth generally we make everybody go through their attorney or through a CPA to complete that process there's also third-party verification sites that you can you can utilize as well so we should dream like should we streamline that by having a back in software to our website that's a private investor portal that they have

to go through the steps in that portal and they can actually walk through all of their closing documents to include that online and then of course our team has to verify everything before we could accept a subscriber into any investment yeah gotcha okay really cool I love too much or just enough I love that so and it's obviously didn't probably start that way but now you've built systems to streamline it like you talked about the increasing speed how can with the speed of trust the speed of just getting a person from

zero to I want to be a full-time investor with foreign capital I love that and you guys it sounds like you've done a very good job over time of streamlining that process it's definitely something that I'll tell you you mean it's not been easy I mean as you know in this world it's not commonplace at this current time so there's pros and cons to it you're pioneering a lot of things but the pro is that you're going to be one of the only people that's putting in this time and effort online and you're

building a brand that people can recognize for many years to come and you're jumping in ahead of all the other people so the competition is much lower I love it okay so walk me through now you get on the phone with them and not even maybe not even just these investors but investors in general how does that look right a lot of people ask me Bridger hi I just don't want to say to an investor I get on the phone I'm nervous how does that conversation go once you get on the phone with the a potential investor okay whatever it is I

got something for you ready yeah let's talk about the phone call before we talk about a border okay if you are working to raise capital whenever I heard this one thing it flipped everything in my brain okay this one thing changed every way the entire way I approached any email the entire way I approached any phone call any engagement and it's this money is a commodity stop thanking people for the opportunity to take their money you're doing them a favor you are offering them something you don't need

to thank them for them considering to utilize your thing you bring value and your value needs to be known inside of you prior to every email and call if they're not the right investor you need to kick them out real quick so my first engagement is actually me qualifying them to find out if it's a good fit I try to disqualify people so that I don't waste my time I try to disqualify people so that they don't waste my time and you should do the same thing so I'm going to give them they should already

have a high level overview they should have already said they're interested before they ever get on the phone with you that's that's how I've set it up now in the olden days I had to play the cold calling game right right you're talking to people you got a referral you'll call this person I wanted to get a lunch meeting a coffee meeting look spend time be direct they will appreciate it and they will respect it so it might look like this if I'm cold calling a Bridgers Zack Moore with boron capital is calling

over real quick I had a I had referral over to you we both know TomTom said you might be interested in looking at these investment offerings with us I did I get you at a terrible time know who I am you know what I'm here for I if you can get a referral please do come in common Yeah right hey we're both in this group I saw you on this gym referred me you know whoever gym is right and is now a terrible time okay on the terrible time question you need to lead with every time because guess what nobody wants a cold call so it's always

a terrible time right so there either that you giving them the liberty to say no first of all you're not trying to trap them into something okay second when they say no I just hit him with a or I would I hit with it you know what it's always a terrible time isn't it perfect I actually wasn't calling to visit with you right now it's a bad time for me too I was just calling over to find out when we could set up a good or I was calling over to get a good time set up would you be opposed to jumping back on the phone tomorrow

afternoon after 3 p.m. hmm or is tomorrow terrible for you it's Thursday terrible for you right whatever it is so if the interest yeah it's actually a terrible time yeah it's always a terrible time isn't it oh I was calling over just to find a good time let's jump back on this and then well I don't know listen I was just calling over to talk about this I know you're into this sort of thing look if you're not interested you can just let me know yes or no right now if you have no interest in learning about new

offerings just tell me yes or no now you know Bridger I'm not really interested in it right now perfect see you later yeah hanging up hang up on a time I love that that's direct it's to the point I love that that's that's perfect saves them time oh I love that and then the qualifying call if they've said yes they're interested the qualifying call is going through this sequencing to ensure and getting them to verify I'm very interested in your deal mm-hmm right so now they know what you

do you know who you are yeah I'd be you know so maybe on that call we booked the follow-up so on this time you know a on the next college want to spend ten minutes with you give you a high-level overview of what we're working on if it makes sense it makes sense if not a you know we we both move on we can look at the next one together yeah so then on the next though you've already set the expectation you set the time you call up okay hey Bridger you know calling over today to talk about this deal I'm gonna

give you the big picture here's where we're at here's what we're doing is this will make sense to you you know if you're going deal based you can do it that way once you've established relationship you know our goal is that our people are going to be investing their entire portfolios with us and we're gonna run everything over and over and over again right but most people aren't aren't interested in that on the first move right so that long-term relationship is built up over time so

especially if you're new and getting started started out they want to try you out right how many times you heard that oh I love it yeah I'll try it out yeah yeah yeah I love I love getting trial investments I yeah give you a trowel investment I'm gonna knock your socks off in six months and you're gonna be putting in you know four times that next year that's what I tell people at least for mine because I'm just new and I'm young yeah anyways that's everyone loves though oh yeah

give you trip I'll invest I'll give you something here right and they loved it that's kind of how a lot of mine go to I love that framework you just built out though of that high anyways sorry I keep cutting you off but I want to hear next now let's continue on right so is that still the phone call or do we want to move to the boardroom now so boardrooms going to be different and a border of investment is always different so I'll just tell you with the structure we have I don't currently have to do a lot of

boardroom I do it I do it I do it differently now a border and pitch getting through of how to crash craft a pitch is would be a massively longer situation but I'll give you guys a great resource actually I got it on my desk I'm gonna plug somebody else here you go go read this book flip the script by Oren Klaff Oren Klaff will talk to you about walking through the pitch and structuring that for investors Warren's a great resource so there's a little plug for him but as far as what we do my goal is how do I get as many

people in front of me at the same time so that I can actually create net time right so rather than one to one a one to one I'm always looking for a zoom call like this I'm jumping on a video conference because I want them to see I want them to see me face-to-face I want them to know I'm real right and then I'm gonna walk them through the pitch right here's what we're actually doing but I've already qualified and they should be 90% closed before I have that call with them right and then it's just finalizing

questions so how do you create resources that work for you so the other thing that we do is we do investor presentations where I'm putting all my list all my people on a single on a single platform and I'm running the pitch to all of these people at the same time so almost like a webinar a big junko correct yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah webinar right I'll run a webinar where I'm walking everybody through the new offering mm-hmm right and then that becomes the content that I can take back to them so for the other people it's you

know hey I'm interested check us out blah blah blah great go here watch this mmm - autumn I love that the speed of yeah just saving everybody time I love that I met a lot of people - actually that that really prefer zoom calls or just cuz it saves time for us to go meet up for lunch we got a drive there or I'm coming here I guess if I'm coming to your boardroom that saves you a little bit of time but still to get ready for a meeting to be there faced if it just takes a lot of time or it could be shortened on a quick

zoom call or a quick webinar at least in it I love that yeah yeah so jumping on a video conference if you have to go one one to one that's a that's a key right because it gives people face time you can instill certainty and confidence right but allowing people to disqualify themselves and just circling back to that you need to allow people to disqualify themselves don't waste your time if it's not the right deal and it doesn't mean that you're that they're that it's you like deal specifics like

people are looking at a variety of things for something to be right right it's not just the risk right and they're looking for I would probably outlining like five things I do I would say there's five things that go into it people are evaluating risk they're valuating reward like return right they're evaluating the scale of the deal right what I mean by that is like there's certain people that aren't gonna look at your deal if they can't put five million dollars into it right not the

right size for them right okay so they're looking at that they're also looking at the timing right where are you at in timing then of course their comfort with you so it can have the right risk and we Ward but be the wrong time for them it can be the right risk and reward profile but not the right size or the scale of the deal so understanding your honor in your actual offer is is very important to whenever you're looking at how you're going to craft this so if you've got a fund that you can do a

million dollars in you're gonna raise a million dollars or five hundred thousand dollars like you're not bringing it to family office mm-hmm you know what I mean yeah it's just not site scale the size of it's way too smooth it's too small it's just not worth their time they need to be eight like if I because here's another breakthrough okay the only bad getting started I started processing through the idea of we had a minimum investment short of 50k so my focus was well I got to go out and find

turn 50k right and so the amount of time I spent on 250k the same amount of time then I later found out was the amount of time I spend on 500k then I realized like started getting people who want to do a million some people asking about five million some people asking about I won't even look at if it's less is fifteen million right and you just realize that you know I remember remember a while back I was looking at a year period we're looking at doing 50 million in a year never would get on a following a guy who was with us with a

huge fund and we were talking through some things and he was on the capillaries inside he's like you know hey I'm super busy right now we were just talking like his friend of mine we're I'm traveling a lot let's get together at this time it's crazy we're trying to close up two billion in the next four months and all of a sudden I was like wait what two billion in four months I was over here thinking about 50 million in 12 months the target changed all of a sudden I realized that in a

fund your opportunity is unlimited and if your focus is only on the smaller things you will only find the smaller things you set your targets appropriately so that you can scale appropriately right so be clear on how you're going to outline and grow if you're targeting people with $25,000 that's what you're going to find you're targeting people with 250 or a million or five million that's what you're going to find now you have to be prepared to steward it appropriately and have the right

structuring for that audience but crafting that and understanding that ahead of time will save you so much time and allow you to leverage your long-term potential boom zak holy crap I love that boom baby seek and ye shall find right I love that and I love what you mention by the fun of it is the most scalable vehicle on the planet just how big do you want to go yeah oh I seriously love what you just mentioned at the end there we're getting close to the end of the hour a few last things before we wrap up
