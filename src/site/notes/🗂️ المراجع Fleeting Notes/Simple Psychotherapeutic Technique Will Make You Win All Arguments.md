so Roger suggested this technique which

I said I would get to the technique he

said the next time you find yourself

embroiled in an argument with someone

that's contentious and uncomfortable say

Institute the following rules you don't

get to respond until you have

recapitulated their Viewpoint and

summarized it in a manner they find

acceptable that's so treacherously

sneaky that rule because what it means

is you have to demonstrate that you

attended to what they say closely enough

and carefully enough to first of all act

out validation of the idea that they

have an opinion worth attending to

that's a big deal people really like

being paid attention to there's nothing

people like more than that unless they

have something to hide and even then

there's a part of them that would rather

have that paid attention to than fail to

pass what would you say to go unnoticed

every cynic is entirely disappointed

when his or her sinister goes

unchallenged because there's a part of

them like a little unwarp part of their

soul that's still alive thinking oh my

God I hope someone calls me on all my

foolishness and cynicism because if they

don't that means that it's valid and

generally applicable and and I'm in hell

and what good is that and so and I

really mean that I really mean that and

so so you're called upon to first of all

summarize what they said which is not an

easy thing right because it means you

have to sometimes it's somewhat

incoherent and emotional latent

especially if it's in the course of an

argument so you have to sort of strike

right to the quick it sounds to me like

this is the point you were making and

then you lay out the point and then you

see they have to be happy with your

summary they have to be pleased with it

which means that you're doing exactly

the opposite of straw Manning the

argument quite the contrary and you're

doing them a favor in some sense by

reducing it to the gist because that's

actually an incredibly complex cognitive

operation I had one client who was

extraordinarily seriously affected and

in the final analysis I don't know if I

was of any help to her because the pit

of family pathology she was in sconced

and was so deep that no matter how far

we dug there was already always a number

a new layer of Lies underneath the lies

we had already worked months to uncover

it was just awful like homicidal level

awful literally terrible but she told me

she went on a tangent that lasted for

four consecutive day clinical sessions

like they weren't the whole day but they

were 50 minutes on four consecutive days

I had no idea where she was going she

was wandering all over in this Freudian

associational Manner and she came to the

point at the end of it it was

unbelievable she tied together this she

was very intelligent woman she tied

together this tremendously long

incoherent ramble into a little bow

right at the end like the punch line of

a remarkable joke and she had extracted

in some sense the gist of what she was

saying as a consequence of of the

circumambulation the wandering through

all this territory and when you listen

to someone very very carefully and

especially if they express themselves

for a while and you say to them well it

sounds to me like this is what you're

saying what you're doing is taking a

tremendous amount of emotionally Laden

material a lot of it unnecessary in the

final analysis because of the ensuing

synthesis and offering them a synthesis

which is a great thing to do especially

if they're happy to accept it because

that also means that you did listen to

them so you signified that they were

worth attending to and then you listen

to them enough to actually understand

what they were saying to try to

understand it and then you did

understand it and then they're way

happier with you even if you're arguing

with them because at least now they know

they can rely on you to be a reliable

listener and that you're not trying to

you know how it is when you're arguing

with someone there's a part of you that

really wants to win it's like I'm right

you're stupid and wrong and so the best

way for me to demonstrate that is to

warp and bend your argument in some make

it trivial in some way it isn't

especially if it's directed to some

degree like elucidating my character

flaws flaws and and to minimize you in

doing so and if you do that of course

well that's not a great road to peace

unless you're willing to bring a big

Club to the argument and and many people

are and instead of listening and trying

to make peace and sort things out

they'll use all sorts of subtle forms of

suppression in their ensuing dialogue

just to keep everything you know under

the rug or in the closet I wouldn't

recommend that as a medium to long-term

strategy especially if you're trying to

bring peace to a household you have to

go through this horribly painful process

of listening to the people around you

tell you what they think of their lives

and if you do that then well maybe you

can all come to a place that is

characterized by something approximating

genuine peace and I would say that even

psychophysiologically you know I mean

when there's tension in a household in

multiple what would you say systems of

value operating simultaneously there's a

tremendous confusion about what should

reign supreme right and you think well

nothing has to reign supreme we can all

have our diverse opinions it's no you

can't not if you're going to live

together in harmony there has to be some

overarching structure that unites you if

there I mean what what else is a family

if it's not an overarching structure

that unites you now within that there

can be tolerance and even appreciation

for necessary individual differences and

obviously there should be but that

doesn't mean there's a not a higher

Unity that the entire organization let's

say is striving for in some Manner and

not only he's striving for but pining

for or even dying for and I I don't use

those words lightly like the absence of

that incorporating higher structures is

a felt sense of catastrophe on the part

of the members of the family they're

always at each other's throats they're

interfering with each other's goals they

can't listen they're in a chronic state

of high hyper arousal because they don't

know what to do ever they're hopeless

because no goals have been clearly

defined and we experience almost all our

hope in relationship to Define goals

this isn't some what would you say

Humanity's

myth or some reality that isn't as

concrete as everything that you see

before you it's quite the contrary and

as far as Rogers was concerned well you

had to let people talk to find out what

they thought so they could find out what

they thought so they could move away

from hell because that's certainly what

you see in clinical practice I mean

people are suffering in ways you can

hardly well you can probably imagine

because no doubt many of you have either

been there or seen people who were there

lived with them you know to move away

from that is that's more real than

anything else if pain is more real than

anything else what's even more real than

pain is whatever we have to fight off

the pain and that's free speech it's

identical with freedom of thought It's

associated with this capacity and

necessity to listen deeply there are

flip sides of the same coin to use a

terrible cliche and all the clinical

data we have including the more

stringently researched research-oriented

clinical inquiry indicates quite clearly

that the exchange of information like

that the generation of of semantic and

emotional information in a state of

relative Freedom the revelation of those

thoughts and then the discursive

analysis of those thoughts say and then

the implementation into action and the

testing of them that is the pathway to

health insofar as that can be attained

by say psychological or spiritual means

and so that's why free speech is not

just another Freedom right among many

it's certainly not Viewpoint diversity

or anything like that it's the it's the

mechanism by which we generate the

conceptions that allow us to organize

our experience in the world it's that

mechanism and more than that it's the

mechanism that allows us to reformulate

and criticize those conceptions when

they've become outdated and sterile to

dissolve them into a chaos that we have

to contend with while it's occurring and

then to reanimate them in a new form so

that we can move into the future
