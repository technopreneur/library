***Many people live out their lives under the assumption that they are the ones in control when it comes to decision making, thought, and behavior — but is that the case?***

**Fair warning**: This topic strikes at our core intuitions about the nature of reality, so be aware that some negative emotions might arise as a consequence of reading this article.

OK, now with that bit out of the way, here’s a refresher on a technical term that I repeatedly use.

~*An* ***axiom*** *is a statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true*~

Most people in the West hold free will to be an axiom without ever thinking about its validity, whether it’s really true or not.

But hey, who can blame us?

It’s an axiom that’s basically as old as history.

Over the past 2,000 years, the idea of free will emerged in [Plato and Aristotle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/) and eventually found its latin form in *liberum arbitrium*. This was during the 4th century when christian philosophers were attempting to reconcile God’s nature with a deterministic universe. The logic runs like this:

-   **Premise 1**: God desires that every person come to a belief in him
-   **Premise 2**: Some people don’t choose to believe in god.
-   **Conclusion**: Therefore, people have free will to not believe in god.

To break it down a little more, the conception of free will (liberum arbitrium) coming out of the conclusion graciously assumes:

1.  God’s goodness excludes him from sending people to hell.
2.  Each of us is therefore free to choose god (heaven) or not (hell).

So there it is, that’s how the first grammatical form of free will took its conceptual shape in our world. It’s the secret sauce for keeping god an all-good being who wants all people to come to salvation in him.

But despite the brow-raising origins of this term, free will, over the years it seems to have solidified itself as how we primarily characterize what it means to be *us*.

Meaning, if someone were to ask you to rank order these 6 things as being words that capture the human experience:

-   Struggle
-   Free will
-   Risk
-   Insecurity
-   Love
-   Suffering

Free will would likely rank in your top 2 (with ‘Love’ probably taking the cake in the #1 spot).

But if free will is at bottom illusory, [as some scientists are now claiming](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/apr/27/the-clockwork-universe-is-free-will-an-illusion) — that it doesn’t exist — then why are we so committed to its existence?

And even in the presence of science giving us good reason to think otherwise!

> This resultant clash between the scientific authority of human sciences and the humanistic image of persons is what scientists are now calling Neuroexistentialism.

Which can also be said to be the existential crisis of the 21st century.

For more on this existential crisis and what we’re doing about it as a society, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq2mVO-9dc0&t=145s) I made on YouTube.

Also, please comment about your own experiences and muses on free will. Is it a helpful illusion that we should preserve, or should we just do away with it?
