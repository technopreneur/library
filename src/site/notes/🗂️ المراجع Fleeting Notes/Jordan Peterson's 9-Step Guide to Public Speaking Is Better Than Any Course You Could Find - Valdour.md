## Jordan Peterson’s 9-Step Guide to Public Speaking Is Better Than Any Course You Could Find

Jordan B. Peterson does a monthly Q&A where he answers questions from his [Patreon’s supporters.](https://valdour.co/2M5R0u6)

One of them asked him for advice to public speaking and he gave an easy, step-by-step framework in just 8 minutes. You can see the [full video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-I5u5hyoxY) 

#### 1\. If you’re gonna speak about something, you need to know 3-4 times as much as you’re gonna speak, at minimum.

#### 2\. Do a lot of background research.

#### 3\. Have multiple stories at hand than you can use to illustrate your point.

#### 4\. Have a point.

#### 5\. Organize the stories as a journey about around the point.

#### 6\. Talk about something you know using your personal experience, you are a master in that.

#### 7\. It’s good to speak directly to the individuals in the audience, one after the other, to see if they’re following at all.

#### 8\. If the audience is dead silent, then you’re on the right track.

#### 9\. There has to be a meaningful output to every fact of a story. Like “How does this fact change the way you perceive the world?

You can follow Mr. Peterson’s work on [his website](https://valdour.co/2Maiz5t), where you will find his podcast, YouTube channel, courses and books.

The best discovery I have made in 2018 is this gentleman.
