Oh capable talked to Stanford smile sure

here's the test version of Stanford

smile

what is your great question of today

what is the name of the President of the

United States I knew you would ask such

question however people might find your

question way too simple a simple common

question may not trigger much

interaction your question is considered

a level one question please tell me

another question what is the mettle to

question a level two question may

trigger simple inference or quick

interpretation resulting in listing

multiple answer choices or options if

all as well please tell me a great

question how many levels are there five

levels so far if you would like to know

what each level question type sounds

like simply ask what each level question

is like I will be happy to explain and

give sample questions now if all is well

please tell me a great question what is

a great question let me give you a

sample question that cannot be answered

by simple recall what would happen to

earth

if infrared light is removed from the

full spectrum of light from Sun if all

as well please share your great question

how is infrared light different from

ultraviolet light your question is

considered a level three question

because your question is not a lower

order thinking question please tell me

another question what is the memo for

question a level four question triggers

much more than simple recall or simple

arithmetic tasks and even simple

analysis or reasoning a question such as

why did the United States decide to drop

out of the UNESCO membership at the end

of 2018 would be considered a level four

question if all as well please tell me a

great question what is a level five

question

a level five question often triggers

innovative thinking and creative

reasoning that may help define a new

solution or product that never existed a

question such as what if we help people

share their homes could it be a new

global business opportunity would be

considered a level five question if all

is well

please share your great question what if

mr. president truth does not meet with

the Kim Chi Minh ever again what will be

the consequence you know what your

question is a much higher order thinking

question therefore your question is

considered a level five question now

please tell me another question why is

it important to keep coming on with

innovative questions

Helen Keller said that a well-educated

mind will always have more questions

than answers Stanford smile is to help

all learners to learn and grow with

critical and creative questions

therefore ask a question to learn change

and innovate please share your great

question today how do you evaluate my

questions your questions are evaluated

based on a deep learning model generated

and constantly updated with over 300,000

pre classified questions the more

questions are collected the more

accurate our evaluation will be if you

want to know how we define different

levels of questions simply ask what each

level question is for example you can

ask what is a level three question and

we will tell you what level three

questions are there are five levels now

if all is well please tell me a great

question why do you want my questions

Peter Abelard said that the key to

wisdom is this constant and frequent

questioning for by doubting we are led

to question by questioning we arrive at

the truth

Stanford smile is to promote the culture

of questioning in classrooms and

eventually in our society

a great question does lead us to

learning innovating and changing our

society without the culture of

questioning we tend to take things for

granted and we simply accept injustice

as a culture we accept prejudice as a

norm and we accept status quo as a

tradition Stanford smile is to help all

learners to learn and grow with critical

and creative questions therefore ask a

question to learn change and innovate

please share your great question today

you pretty good I am happy to be useful

for you why don't we continue please

tell me a great question well I'm so

tired right now hope you enjoyed this

session goodbye
