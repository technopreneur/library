**Background and Objective**:
The study aimed to determine if reading books offers health benefits beyond other reading materials and if it provides a survival advantage. The hypothesis was that book reading promotes cognitive engagement, which could lead to a longer lifespan.

**Methods**:

- **Data Source**: The study used data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a national telephone survey conducted biennially since 1992 among adults over age 50. The study also utilized the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS) from 2001, which contained questions about reading habits.

- **Sample**: The final sample consisted of 3,635 individuals, with 27.4% of the sample dying during an average of 9.49 years of follow-up. The majority (62%) of the sample was female.

- **Reading Assessment**: Participants were asked about the hours they spent reading books and periodicals (newspapers or magazines) in the past week. Reading was categorized into tertiles, with the first tertile serving as the reference group.

- **Survival**: Vital status of participants was determined by matching them to the National Death Index. The follow-up time was calculated from the first CAMS survey until either death or December 31, 2012.

- **Cognitive Engagement**: Cognitive engagement was assessed using a total cognitive score based on 8 items, including immediate recall, delayed recall, serial 7s, and other mental status indicators. The study used the change in cognitive score from 2000 to 2004 as a measure.

**Findings**:

- Book reading provided a survival advantage, with book readers experiencing a 20% reduction in the risk of mortality over the 12-year follow-up compared to non-book readers.

- The survival advantage for book reading was greater than that for reading newspapers or magazines.

- Cognitive engagement, as measured by the total cognitive score, was identified as a mediator for the survival advantage associated with book reading.
