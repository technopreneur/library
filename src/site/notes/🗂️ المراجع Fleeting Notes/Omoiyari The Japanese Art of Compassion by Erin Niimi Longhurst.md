The most important lesson I have learned from this book (personally) is to have more compassion for myself. I know the book is about empathy for others, but isnt it hypocrite, to give others empathy, without giving it to myself? In this book you learn a lot about the Japanse art of compassion, which we all should include in our lives to give people special moments they wont forget. Every experience should be one to remember.

I always in awe with Japanese culture and manners. Omoiyari is a form of selfless compassion but in this book I think it cover more broad topics in all aspect of our daily life where we can relate to it. Reading this when you want to start anew, refresh start, and celebrating the new year, I think it’s a great book with tips and advices where you and I can incorporate in our life. To change your habits, to be better human, to initiate kindness, to be kind to people and nature. To practice a self [...more](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52848030-omoiyari#)

'Let the past drift away with the water' is but one of the many Japanese words of wisdom quoted in lavishly illustrated (in a restrained and beautiful way) Omoiyari, which is all about bringing joy into your own life and that of others, which perusing and ruminating on certainly brought me [...more](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52848030-omoiyari#)

Well, this book is similar to 'Lagom', 'Hygge', and other books about some cultural aspects and wisdoms from a country, and how we can adopt them to improve our lives. This book mostly explains about compassion and empathy that would bring peace and harmony in life. Not only related to human-beings but also with our surrounding and environment.

Decorated with pretty photos of Japan and some practical tips (like how to fold furoshiki, simple origami or make simple dish), I like it and it's a good

A beautiful book. I picked this one because I love all things Japanese. And this book didn't disappoint me. With beautiful illustrations, designing, typography, quotes, concepts and examples this book kept me hooked till the last page. A must-read if you love Japanese culture.

The concept of compassion as an art was well-executed with the author's personal upbringing. Illustrations are simply beautiful and go well with the content. In my opinion it is definitely a coffee/tea table book. [...more](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52848030-omoiyari#)

Four Stars for the lovely pictures.

I enjoyed learning deeper about the beautiful side of Japanese culture. However, sometimes the author takes a tone that's slightly bossy which turns me off. I react this way because I am in Indonesia, and one of the big issues we constantly talk about here is the atrocities of the Japanese invasion from 1942-1945. It's so much horror.

There are always 2 sides of a certain culture. So I enjoyed learning about the beautiful side from this book.

This is the second book by Erin Niimi Longhurst but I read this first.

Omoi reflects the concept of thought, the way people think or their feelings, emotions, sentiments or desires. Omoiyari is an extension of this thinking in relation to others - a type of projection. The simplest way to describe it might be to anticipate the needs of others, in an altruistic way that is imbued with empathy without the expectation of reward or anything in return.

Omoiyari is important because, in a larger scheme

It may be biased, but I loved Erin’s first book, A Little Book of Japanese Contentments, and wanted more and that’s exactly what Omoiyari is.

While you do not have to read the first book before you read this book, I would highly recommend both but let’s get into the review of this one: Omoiyari.

Omoiyari dives into the depths of Japanese culture; more specifically the practical and spiritual side of Japanese culture. This ranges from all sorts of important topics such as avoiding waste and cleanli

I read the majority of this while waiting for my car to be serviced. You'll learn about the Japanese concept of compassion, which is about anticipating the needs of others and fulfilling those needs, like keeping a clean environment, showing basic manners while in public, not being wasteful, etc. Nicely designed, it's a calming read with some stories about the author and her grandparents. The author is half-Japanese and half-British, so she discusses how both sides of her family show care and re [...more](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52848030-omoiyari#)

Having read 'Japonisme' by the author, I really enjoyed reading 'Omoiyari' and learning more about certain aspects of Japanese culture and how the practices can cultivate compassion and mindfulness. I feel like I learnt a lot having read this and it made me reflect a lot on my own behaviour and of those around me too. [...more](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52848030-omoiyari#)

Some helpful reminders about anticipating the needs of others and acting selflessly. I liked how the book was organized and it is beautiful, but felt a bit repetitive and I didn’t expect that so much of it would be about material things.

I read through this comparing it to similar reads, like The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning or Marie Kondo’s book. I found this one quite a bit less organized. It’s more like a grab bag of Japanese cultural words. Still, it is a beautiful book and would probably make a lovely gift.

Really enjoyed what for me was an introduction to Japanese culture and its applicability to life outside of Japan. Plus the beautiful imagery was an added bonus !

Omoiyari is beautifully written and explains in succinct detail many Japanese customs and cultural references.

I learned so much about heritage and culture.

Amazing book!

For me, this is a beautiful book, I learned about the Japanese lifestyle and I think if we practice the good habits in this book, we can be happier.

A delightful, practical guide to omoiyari (compassion, acting in a thoughtful way towards others) and practices it is built upon, like wa (the desire for harmony, tranquility), with tangible examples of how to implement omoiyari in our daily lives, not only regarding how we treat others but also the world, from the wider planet to the items in our homes.

The good: This book offered a lot of different information about Japanese culture and practices. It contained beautiful illustrations and photos to go along with the text.

The bad: It was bit all over the place and random at times. I also contained a lot of filler information that I thought was unnecessary.
