When I first came across the Zettelkasten method of note-taking, I was confused. It took me a while to get a hold of it. I read every article on the web and watched every video on youtube. But even after so much research, one thing I couldn’t understand was the difference between literature notes and permanent notes.

Along with all the articles and videos I read and watched, Sonke Ahrens's book, how to take smart notes helped me get a better perspective on the difference between these different types of notes. In this article, I will try help you understand the difference between fleeting, literature and permanent notes. These in turn will make you a better note-taker.

## Fleeting Notes:

Fleeting notes are the ideas or reminders that can pop into your head at any time. They are the everyday thoughts that you may think are important.

Ideas are like people and if you don’t capture them they will go away. To capture these fleeting notes, you can have a simple notebook or an inbox system on your device.

Fleeting notes don’t serve any purpose rather than helping you to develop permanent notes. They will eventually end up in the trash. Therefore, it doesn’t matter where or how you write these notes as long as you revisit them within a day or two.

If your thoughts are already sorted, and you have time you can skip the step of writing fleeting notes. You can directly write down your ideas as a permanent note.

## Literature Note

Whenever you read, watch or listen to something create a note about the content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or what you can use in your own future writing.

Don’t just copy. Understand first and then write it in your own words. A literature note is your interpretation of what the author is trying to say.

In challenging cases, you may need to elaborate your notes while in some cases, just jotting down some keywords might be sufficient.

> “Sometimes it is necessary to slowly work our way through a difficult text and sometimes it is enough to reduce a whole book to a single sentence.” — Sonke Ahrens

## How and when to write literature notes

It is important to have a pen and paper or a keyboard under your hand whenever you are consuming content. It can be anything. A book, blog post, video, lecture, or seminar, doesn’t matter. Jot down the important ideas that can be useful in your own research. Here are few rules you can follow to create literature notes:

-   Keep it short and be extremely selective. Don’t write something that you will not come back to
-   Don’t just copy. Understand and write it in your own words
-   Fill all literature notes with bibliographical details and keep all of them in the same place.

## Permanent Note

The permanent note is the soul of the Zettelkasten system. All the fleeting notes and literature notes are only meant to help you write permanent notes. The permanent note is what adds real value to your system.

It will never be thrown away and contains all the necessary information in itself. They are always stored in the same way in the same place. Every permanent note holds a single idea and is elaborated enough to have the potential to become a part of or inspire a final written piece.

Literature notes were your interpretations of the author's thoughts. They are written in the context of the source they are inspired from. Permanent notes, however are written in the context of your own ideas and thoughts. They are written to link these interpretations with what you already have.

When creating permanent notes, you don’t just copy the author’s thoughts. You think for yourself; how you can relate an idea with what is relevant for your research.

The main idea of the Zettelkasten system is not to collect notes but to develop ideas, arguments, and discussions.

> Can you add something? Does something contradict? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them? — Sonke Ahrens

## When and how to write permanent notes

Ideally once a day, you have to go back through your fleeting notes and literature notes. If an idea is relevant, you can create a permanent note.

Literature notes are written for yourself to help you write permanent notes while permanent notes are written with an audience in mind.

> Permanent notes are directed towards an audience ignorant of the thoughts behind the text and unaware of the original context, only equipped with a general knowledge of the field. — Sonke Ahrens

A permanent note should be able to interpret the idea itself. Here are a few rules to follow while writing permanent notes:

-   Permanent notes should be atomic in nature i.e. Each note should contain one idea only.
-   Write in full sentences
-   Be precise, clear, and as brief as possible
-   It should contain all the necessary information in itself
-   Make references
-   Link it with other relevant notes

## Final Note

Zettelkasten system is a simple note-taking system but not an easy one. It will demand you to think, understand and question what you consume. But most people are not willing to do this. But if you do this is one of the most effective strategies you can use for being a better learner and a creator.
