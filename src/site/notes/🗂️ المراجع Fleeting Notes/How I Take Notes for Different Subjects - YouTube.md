These are two frameworks for taking note-taking depending on the subject. Classes like math and science are more heavy on calculations while classes like literature or history are more heavy on arguments. These 2 simple frameworks are from How to Become a Straight A Student by Cal Newport. I'll also be showing you some walkthrough examples. 

so schools don't typically teach us how  to take good notes which is crazy  because it's a difficult skill to learn  especially if you're taking different  subjects like math or science which is  very technical versus literature or  history which is very text heavy so  we've created multiple note-taking  tutorials in our ultimate study skills  series and this video in particular will  cover how to take better notes for any  subject these Frameworks come from how  to become a straight A student at Cal  Newport he was a tough Ivy league  student and then he went around  interviewing other top students around  the country now he's a professor at  Georgetown University so he speaks from  multiple perspectives on this  note-taking topic so let's Dive Right In  in general we have two types of classes  first we have the non-technical classes  like literature history or poli-sci  these classes usually involve long dry  reading assignments then we have the  technical classes like math science  economics these usually involve problem  sets calculations code and equations so  let's start with the non-technical  classes right the three-part framework  here is what what Cal Newport calls qec  question evidence conclusion so the goal  is to make notes that clearly state qec  for every big idea but it's not as easy  as it sounds the good news is that a lot  of professors will teach information in  this framework they'll pose a question  and they'll walk through some evidence  and they'll reach a conclusion and then  they repeat this process over and over  for the rest of lecture and the bad news  is that they don't tell you which info  is the queue or the e or the C right  some professors just love to ramble they  go off topic and then we're left trying  to figure out what's actually important  sometimes the professors won't even  State the questions so be sure to put a  star to remind yourself to come back and  figure it out because it's probably  going to be a test question sometimes  they'll just hint at a conclusion but  they won't write out say it so it's up  to us again to figure that out all right  so let's do a quick example here because  sometimes the conclusions are not  exactly straightforward let's say that  the professor poses this question who is  the greatest basketball player so I'll  write that as the question and then be  on the lookout for evidence and  conclusion so during like sure the  professor might give a simple conclusion  like Michael Jordan right and the  evidence might be several points  highlighting how many championships he  played or how he changed the culture of  basketball or something but it's not  always going to be that simple right  because the professor could say that it  depends or you might have multiple  reading assignments that all look at  different Bodies of Evidence and they  all arrive at different conclusions so  for example the conclusion might depend  on which analysts you ask or it might  depend on what stats you're comparing or  what about LeBron James Sometimes a  question can have complex conclusions or  multiple conclusions you have to be able  to group together which evidence  supports which conclusion so make your  qecs as clear as possible another quick  tip here is if you're using an app with  toggles like notion then one thing you  can consider doing is nesting your  conclusions and evidence under toggles  to making review sessions more efficient  so the conclusion isn't obvious then you  gotta do whatever it takes to figure it  out right ask questions during class to  clarify or ask the professor after class  or go to office hours or ask your  friends but you want to make sure that  you complete as many qecs as possible  during or immediately after class when  the information is still fresh in your  head because when it comes time to  review for the exam you want a study  guide that's easy to review right you  don't want to be spending more time  trying to relearn or figure out what you  wrote all right let's switch over to the  technical classes Cal neoport doesn't  explicitly State this framework but  we'll call it the PSA problem steps  answer so he states that the key to  taking notes in a technical course is to  forget the big ideas and record as many  sample problems as possible I don't  agree with this actually I think that  big ideas are very important in  technical courses I think that if you  can forget about all the numbers at  first and just focus on understanding  the math in words that will make it much  easier to learn so for PSA your  professors will most like likely give  you the sample problems and answers so  be sure to save them or print them or  write them down but that's the easy part  the hard part is writing out all the  steps on how to solve those problems and  annotating those steps  so a quick example here I'm writing out  the steps that lead to the answer but  I'm also annotating those steps right  I'm taking notes about what steps are  being used when they're being used and  why they're being used at that time  because I want to understand the math of  the science not just in numbers but also  in words right so literally writing out  the explanations if I need to or using  arrows or Bolding important parts so  some professors move really fast and if  you don't understand raise your hand and  ask questions especially to clarify the  annotations if you need to then put a  question mark and maybe come back later  because recording the steps without the  annotations is just useless right we  don't want to learn technical courses by  rope memorizing the steps we want to  understand when to use which steps and  apply it to any problem on the exam now  most beginner students don't even have a  framework for taking notes so the qec  the PSA these are really good places to  start however if you're trying to become  a top student there are some limitations  to these methods in particular they  mainly facilitate learning information  in isolation yes you might have the qecs  for a class but did you take time to  synthesize multiple qvcs together and  form the big picture yes you have the  full PSAs for every sample problem but  what if the variables and steps were  slightly changed do you understand the  reasoning behind the steps enough to  nail those curveball questions on the  exam because when we evaluate or  synthesize information in this way gives  us a deeper understanding and that goes  beyond the qec or the PSA method so we  do have more advanced note-taking videos  like the Mind mapping one for example  but I'd recommend that before you go  there to check out this video right here  because it covers a framework on how to  achieve deeper understanding of what  you're learning which will ultimately  make your notes more concise and more  effective for review I'll see you there
