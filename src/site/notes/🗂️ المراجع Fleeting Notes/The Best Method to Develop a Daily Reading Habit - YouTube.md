**The Best Method to Develop a Daily Reading Habit - YouTube**

- **Introduction**
  - Speaker has a love for books but struggles with the vast number of books and other distractions.
  - Emphasizes the importance of setting and tracking reading goals daily.

- **Parker's Background**
  - Introduced as Parker Settekase, a philosopher.
  - Aims to help viewers study and think more deeply.

- **Main Tool: The Reading Log**
  - It's a basic tool but can be life-changing for some.
  - Tool is essentially a reading log or daily page number log.
  - There are nuances in how to use it effectively.

- **Why the Reading Log?**
  - While many methods exist, the daily reading log has proven to be the best for Parker.
  - Shares personal history: used to hate reading until he started using the log.
  - This method is universal and can be used by anyone.

- **Setting Daily Reading Goals**
  - Two broad approaches: top-down and bottom-up.
  - **Top-down approach**:
    1. Plan out reading 52 books in a year, break it down by week, and then pages per day.
    2. Estimate the average number of pages in a book and set a daily goal based on reading 52 books a year.
  - **Bottom-up approach**:
    1. Determine how many pages you can read daily.
    2. Multiply that by 365 to get a yearly page goal.

- **How to Use the Reading Log**
  - Parker has tracked daily page goals since November 30th, 2015.
  - Process involves:
    - Writing the date and title of the book.
    - Noting the start and end page numbers for the day.
    - Totaling the number of pages read daily.
    - Tallying the total for the month.
    - Parker likes physical notebooks; uses a lined journal for this purpose.

- **Digital vs. Analog**
  - Mentions Goodreads, a popular digital book tracking tool.
  - Prefers analog method (physical notebook) as it's more tactile and less distracting.
  - Sees value in Goodreads for community, but currently prefers analog.

- **Conclusion**
  - To develop a reading habit, use a daily reading log.
  - Setting a goal is crucial.
  - The simplicity of the method is its strength.
  - Encourages viewers to like, comment, and subscribe for more study habit videos.

I love books I really really love books but I've got a problem there are so many books that I want to read just vying for my attention and there are so many other things that deserve my attention not to mention those things that don't deserve my attention but steal it anyways so I've learned that if I want to be a reader and I want to make progress on all these different books I need to set reading goals and I need to track those goals every single day welcome to park notes I'm Parker settekase I'm a philosopher here to help

you study and think more deeply in this video I'm going to introduce you to the very best tool for developing a daily reading Habit to some of you it's going to be very basic and obvious to others it may be life-changing like it was for me the tool is very simple it's just a reading log or a daily page number log but there's a couple things you need to know in order to use this properly so make sure you watch to the end so you can become an expert in using a daily reading log let's Jump Right In so today

there are a lot of different methods and tips and tricks for reading more but I found the daily reading log to be the best I used to hate reading I used to fall asleep on my homework assignments I'd wake up drooling in my books until I discovered the daily reading log or the daily page number log I didn't find this on YouTube or read it in any book I just kind of did it myself and then came to find out this is a common thing that people use for studying this tool is universal if you're good at reading you

can use this if you're bad at reading you can also use this it's just a way for you to set a reading goal and then track kit every single day so before we go into the details on the reading log as a tool we need to come up with our daily reading goal there are two broad approaches to coming up with your daily reading goal a top-down approach and a bottom-up approach I used to use this top-down approach and I actually don't like it but let me give you two ways you can use a top-down approach for coming

up with your daily page number goal maybe you say hey I want to read 52 books this year that's one book a week so you go and you plan out every single book that you're going to read for every single week if you look up the page numbers for each individual book that you're going to read and you divide that by seven so that you can stay on track every day to finish reading that book in that week now that's a lot of work and you have to have a lot of foresight to say I'm going to read this book I'm

going to want to read this book in three months when it comes to that I have a harder time my interests wax and Wayne I'm not sure that I like that method that much but the second top-down method would be to say I want to average 52 books a year and so I can look up the average number of pages in the average book I can multiply that by 52 one for each week and then I can divide that number by 365 to come up with the average amount of pages I should read every single day now that's a decent method I've used this as well I like

this one better than actually mapping out every individual book that I want to read for a year but at the end of the day the goal of reading 52 books in a year is a little bit arbitrary one a week I guess that's kind of cool but what happens the next year are you going to do that every single year what matters more than accomplishing the certain task of reading 52 books in a year is that you become a reader that you read every day that you Embrace this lifestyle of continued learning so I actually like a bottom-up approach this

one's much easier you say how many pages do I think that I can read in a single day if you read one page a day you're going to read 365 pages in a year that's at least one book now double that now you have two books now triple that quadruple that keep going on and on and you can average out hey I will probably get this many books a year but that's actually not as important as you continually reading every single day if you develop a daily habit of reading the book pile will grow you'll look back and

say wow I can't believe how many books I actually read this year so don't limit yourself maybe you'll read way more than 52 books if you read 75 Pages a day but depending on the genre that you read you'll be able to read more or less books that doesn't matter as much set a daily page number goal that is reasonable for you to achieve but is also going to challenge you it's just like lifting weights Progressive overload you can read more and more as you continue to read as you continue to

stretch your reading muscles and expand your mind so you can come up with your daily page number goal by using one of the two top-down methods if you have a different method that's top down let me know I'd love to hear it leave me a comment but I like the bottom-up method it's reasonable for me but it's still going to be a challenge it's still going to stretch me and make me grow you can change your daily goal if it's too easy if it's too hard but come up with a daily goal then multiply that daily goal

by 365 and that will be your yearly goal you can divide that yearly goal number by 300 which is like the average book and you can get a rough estimate for how many books you will read in a given year so let's say you either use a top down or bottom up approach to coming up with a daily page number goal now you're going to write that goal in the front of your reading log I like to use a physical notebook this is where I'm going to capture and log all the pages that I actually read for a given day so

let me show you how I use my daily reading log so my method for tracking daily page number goals has been the same since November 30th 2015. I know that because I keep Good Records here it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and anyone can do it with any kind of Journal I like these lined ones you can go Square you can go dotted whatever but I like the line ones I like just writing this is history of Western philosophy and theology I abbreviate it because I'm not writing out that whole thing so I write down the book I write down the

page numbers I started at and where I finished then I will block out the number of pages I'll do that for each book I read that day some of you may just be reading one book that's fine I like to read multiple books at once I will add those up and then I'll Circle the total for the day to see a lot of circles on here circling the total for the day allows me to go back when I'm tallying up my monthly page numbers to just look at one number per day and then I can add them all up at the end of the month and I'll highlight that

number so that when I'm looking back in December I only need to find 12 numbers to add up so for instance here's 2017 there's the total for December then I added up all the page numbers from each month and I got 13 739 Pages for 2017. can't remember if that's my goal or not but I do have the goal in here somewhere so here's my first one going all the way back to 2015.

here's my second one same method you can see all the way through there's 2018 2019 same exact method I would love doing this it's really helpful for me so again it's super simple you just write down the title of the book you write down the page you started at and when you're done with that session you write down the page you ended at maybe you get back into that book twice that day just start another entry and then block off the number of pages you got to add them all up at the end of the day and circle that then when you're done with the months

tally them all up and circle that I like to highlight it so that when I'm looking back for my yearly goals all I need to look for is 12 numbers here's the current one I'm working with I have a Saddleback leather surprise surprise this is a really old version of the mole skin cover I have a hardback moleskin medium moleskin in my Saddleback reading log floss Raptor of course let me see Philosoraptor other places so I have my Frost Raptor sticker that reminds me to be a good Velociraptor but same message here going all the way to

2020 and all the way to the present I love doing it this way if you guys have a better one again let me know in the comments I want to hear from you but I've used this to help me keep on track with my own goals to help me become a reader to become someone who just reads this is part of my life I have goals I have ways of capturing those goals and I have reminders outside in the world not in the digital world that remind me oh yeah I need to be reading oh yeah I have daily goals to be hitting oh yeah I need

to mark down those goals so let's run a test case here or use this one since I have some space at the end that's empty so let's say that I'm reading Dune again I'm going to start by writing the date and then the title of the book if it's a new book then I'll write the author's name too just so I know so there's Dune that's by Herbert I should know what that is later on I might just put Dune I'm gonna just put Dune because I don't need to keep writing Hardware I'll be

able to see from Context what book it is and let's say that we started that page 335. I'm gonna start by running just page 3 35 and I'll put a dash so I know that I'm starting there I'm going through and that's an uncompleted loop I need to come back to that I need to enter in that data for when I'm done reading let's say that I was a beast and I got to like 389.

boom so that's still not complete I need to do the math and figure out what's the number there shoot now I gotta figure out the math I think that's 54 pages then I'm going to bracket that out so that's the completed for this book during this session if I went back and read again later in the day maybe I'll do just the same so I don't need to write it down again and this time I went from page 389 to 399 so the math is easier now it's 10 pages boom let's see I then went and read

Pascal's Pont says and let's say that we started at page 10 and went through 25 there's 15 pages sometimes I'll write pages I think I like writing Pages better than just the number that's to each his own then we just total these up there's 64 74 79. this is a good day now when I'm going back through all I need to look for is the 79 pages and it's simple as that so naturally being a book guy people always ask me what about Goodreads what about Goodreads I don't really like Goodreads

all that much I'm not good at it I'm not good at like keeping track and finding all the books it's just so much easier for me to write it down I know some people love Goodreads they swear by it they want to see other people that's cool if you guys like Goodreads then go ahead and do Goodreads I like having the physical copy I really really like seeing it I like it not being in my smartphone where there's all these other icons and stuff we're just supposed to draw my attention away from what I want to be doing so for

me having it in the digital space is not great but I have this I can put it in my nightstand I can put it on my desk on my table where I see oh yeah I'm supposed to be reading oh yeah I have daily goals oh yeah I need to close the loop on that and write down how many goals I got last night or yesterday I just I forgot so here it is it's a good reminder and when I look at this I'm reminded of books I'm reminded of my reading goals I'm not reminded to check Facebook to check Instagram I'm not reminded of all my

emails so I may get better at doing good reads just for the community aspect but for now I really really like an analog model I'm showing myself that I take it really really seriously so seriously that I have its own book I like to wrap it in leather a lot of people aren't going to go for that that's fine you don't have to I'm not trying to Hawk Saddleback though if you guys want to partner up hit me up because I will promote your stuff anyways that's neither here nor there I am not a huge Goodreads guy sorry okay

so let's sum it all back up if you want to become a reader and develop a daily habit of reading then you should use a daily reading log in order to use this properly you need to come up with a goal you can do this top down by saying I want to read X number of books in a given year and then dividing that down or you can build it bottom up building up to your year goal I know it seems pretty simple that's because it is and I think that's the beauty of this method if you guys like this video make sure to

leave me a like and drop a comment I want to hear from you guys have you used this method before do you think you'll start using this method or do you have a better method for capturing your daily page number goals if you currently have a daily page number goal what is it I want to hear from you guys how many pages are you reading every day or at least trying to read every day make sure you subscribe so you don't miss any future videos on study habits I'll see you guys next time
