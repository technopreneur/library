## The Kybalion

2022-11-26 15:59

A new age religion of sorts that has some similar correlation in Islamic literature. Focuses on the Mind, Polarity, Gender, Motion, Rhythms, Cause, and Effect.

The Kybalion shares several principles that may have correlations with Islamic literature. These include:

1. The Principle of Mentalism: This principle states that "The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental." This could correlate with the Islamic belief in the omnipresence and omnipotence of Allah, who is the ultimate source of all creation and existence.

2. The Principle of Correspondence: This principle, "As above, so below; as below, so above," may correlate with the Islamic belief in the mirroring of the spiritual and physical realms.

3. The Principle of Vibration: This principle, "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates," could be seen as a reflection of the Islamic belief in the constant activity of Allah in maintaining the universe.

4. The Principle of Polarity: This principle could correlate with the Islamic concept of the balance between good and evil, and the existence of opposites in the world.

5. The Principle of Rhythm: This principle could correlate with the Islamic practices of regular prayer and fasting, which follow a rhythmic pattern.

6. The Principle of Cause and Effect: This principle aligns with the Islamic belief in Qadr, or divine predestination, where everything happens according to Allah's plan.

7. The Principle of Gender: This principle, "Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles; gender manifests on all planes," could correlate with the Islamic belief in the balance and complementarity of male and female principles in creation.

Please note that these are potential correlations and interpretations, and may not be universally accepted or agreed upon by all scholars or practitioners of Islam.
