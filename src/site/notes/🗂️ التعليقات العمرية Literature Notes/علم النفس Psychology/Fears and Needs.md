## Fears and Needs 

2022-09-24 12:15

Grace LaConte draws an intriguing correlation between Fears, Feelings, and Needs. Also Fear is a hardwired response by the brain in humans and has been established so it is a truth.

Fears to Feelings

Extinction = I will cease to exist
Mutilation = I will feel to be harmed or invaded
Separation = I feel rejected
Ego Death = I feel Humiliated
Loss of Autonomy = I won't be myself

تقول قريس لاكونت أن هناك شبه بين المخاوف الخمس لدى البشر وبين ما يشعرون

الخوف مجسدا كشعور
الفناء = سوف افنى آبدا
التجريح = سوف أضر أو يتعدى علي
الفراق = سوف الفظ
موت السيرة = سوف أهان
فقد الذات = لن أكون أنا
