## People are Rocks الناس كالصخر

2022-11-14 06:22

يرسم روبرت تشبيهًا مفاده أنه إذا مشيت وضربت صخرة بقدمك ؛ هل تغضب؟ لا. كذلك الناس ، لديهم غرور ومشاكل. بدلًا من الانزعاج من حالتهم العاطفية السلبية التي لا تفيدك ، يجب أن تتقبل كيف هم.

Robert draws an analogy that if you walk, and you hit a rock by your foot ; do you get angry? No. So are people, they have egos and problems. Instead of being annoyed with how they are, with negative emotional that isn't doing you good, you should accept how they are.
