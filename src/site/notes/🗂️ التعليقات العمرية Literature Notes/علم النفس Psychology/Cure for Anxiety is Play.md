#### Tim Ferriss’s Assistant’s Sudden Resignation Serves as a Warning for Trying to Have It All  by Tim Denning  The Startup  Jul, 2022  Medium

> One day Charlie had a [major breakthrough](http://charliehoehn.com/2013/05/19/how-i-cured-my-anxiety/). A friend introduced him to a guy called David. David suggests they catch up for coffee. But Charlie had a bizarre idea.
> 
> “You wanna play catch instead of do coffee, man?”
> 
> “Sounds like a f\*cking blast dude.”
> 
> They had an awesome time. Play was exactly what Charlie needed. He didn’t do it before because play meant he wasn’t doing his work which led to guilt.
> 
> The obsession with play led Charlie to do 6 weeks of 3-hour improv classes. This became the weird cure for Charlie’s burnout and anxiety.
> 
> He says “play” allowed him to stop taking his life so freaking seriously. Instead of looking for friends, he suggests we look for playmates.
> 
> The killer choice Charlie says we have to make is: 1) Anxiety 2) Play.
