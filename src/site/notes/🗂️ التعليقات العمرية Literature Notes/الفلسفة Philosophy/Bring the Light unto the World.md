## Bring the Light unto the World

2022-09-07 21:12

Jordan says you should take care of yourself as everyone has a light and when you take care of yourself you bring that light to this dim and dark place the world. If you do not bring that light to the world the place becomes dark and dark things happens in darkness.

Stark correlation with 

 (أَوَ مَن كَانَ مَيْتاً فَأَحْيَيْنَاهُ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُ نُوراً يَمْشِي بِهِ فِي النَّاسِ كَمَن مَّثَلُهُ فِي الظُّلُمَاتِ لَيْسَ بِخَارِجٍ مِّنْهَا كَذَلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِلْكَافِرِينَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ )الأنعام122

Also I think the possible meaning of bringing Light to the world means Knowledge presumably
