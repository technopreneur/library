## How to Read

2022-08-28 20:01

Very basically a book should be read in 3 layers or 3 go's as per the so called "Barbell Method"
1) First round you skim through the book and mark or highlight interesting concepts or ideas
2) Then 2nd time around you add Literature Notes on those ideas
3) 3rd time you Review those notes and add Links to other Literature Notes and possible Add a Permanet Idea
