A Korean failure student immigrant become Dean at Stanford and devised these 5 levels of question types.

1) Level 1 Question: a level one question is a question that can be answered by simple recall.
2) Level 2 Question: a level two question may trigger simple inference or quick interpretation, resulting in listing multiple answer choices or options.
3) Level 3 Question: a level three question is a question that cannot be answered by simple recall. What would happen to earth if infrared light is removed from the full spectrum of light from the Sun.
4) Level 4 Question: a level four question triggers much more than simple recall or simple arithmetic tasks and even simple analysis or reasoning, a question such as, why did the United States decide to drop out of the UNESCO membership at the end of 2018
5) Level 5 Question: a level five question often triggers innovative thinking and creative reasoning that may help define a new solution or product that never existed a question such as, what if we help people share their homes could it be a new global business opportunity.

Peter Abelard said that the key to wisdom is this constant and frequent questioning, for by doubting we are led to question, by questioning we arrive at the truth
