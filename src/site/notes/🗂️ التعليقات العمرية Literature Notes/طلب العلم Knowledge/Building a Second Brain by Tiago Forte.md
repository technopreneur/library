## Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte

2022-09-09 07:41

Tiago talks about the common notion of building a Personal Knowledge Based using 4 steps

1) Capture
2) Organize
3) Distill
4) Express

Which is similar to the Zettelkasten method where

Capture = Fleeting Notes
Organize = Tags & Links
Distill = Literature Notes
Express = Permanent Notes

Also, Tiago says to remember then Connect then Create which is similar again to Review in the Zettelkasten approach.

One striking thing is a study on how to remember words ; in short the study asked people to recall words they recalled vs asking them to recall the words but after giving synonyms. Of course, those that gave  synonyms recalled the words much better
