You can be a better speaker by 3 techniques

1) Alliteration: the fun repetition of any consonant sound in two or more closely associated words.
2) Metaphors: a figure of speech that describes an object or action as if it were something else typically bestowing upon something ordinary the qualities of some something possessing heavy imagery.
3) Classical Flavor: particular words and expressions that were common denominators in nearly every articulate speaker.
