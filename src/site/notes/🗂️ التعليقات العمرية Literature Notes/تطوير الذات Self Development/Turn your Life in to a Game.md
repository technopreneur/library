when i was younger i used to play a lot

of video games

but as i grew older they started taking

too much time from my other activities

for this reason i started to gradually

reduce the time i spent playing them

until i eventually quit but recently i

decided to incorporate some more down

time into my schedule

and i gave video games another shot this

is when i remembered just how fun video

games can be

it wasn't long before i was looking

forward to the end of the day

just so i could hop on the computer and

play but this also got me wondering

what exactly made those games so

compelling and could i somehow apply

those game elements to other areas of my

own life to make them more desirable

this is what i've learned most video

games are structured in a way so that

throughout the game our brain

consistently releases dopamine

i'm sure many of you are already aware

but for those of you who don't know

dopamine is a neurotransmitter

associated with wanting and desire

it's one of the reasons why we want to

repeat certain behaviors

over and over and why we have the

motivation to pursue something

you could say that dopamine is kind of

like a carrot on a stick

wherever the carrot goes we want to

follow and video games are really good

at constantly dangling this carrot right

in front of you

especially rpgs also known as

role-playing games where you level up

and play a fictional character in a

virtual world

these types of games can be particularly

addicting because they have what i like

to call

a dopamine trail essentially the game

has

a lot of different components that

consistently trigger the release of

dopamine

over and over this way we don't get

bored and we want to continue playing

now i've identified 5 key elements that

form this dopamine trail which you can

actually replicate

in your own life but just to clarify

i'll be using rpgs as an example

as they resemble our lives the most not

every single game has all the components

i'm going to talk about

however they probably have at least a

few so

let's take a look at those elements

let's see how you can take control of

the carrot and make your own daily

activities more compelling

the first key element is that you always

have a clear objective to work towards

and you know what you should be doing

maybe you need to kill a dragon or

rescue a princess

it doesn't matter what's important is

that you know in which direction you

need to go

in real life however many of us don't

really know what we're working towards

and while other people can set direction

for us it's not the same as when we set

the path

ourselves whether it's running a

marathon

reaching a certain position at work or

writing your own book

having a clear goal you're working

towards gives your actions purpose

otherwise your efforts just feel

meaningless

but while killing a dragon might be the

end goal the game doesn't really make

you focus on that too much

instead it's broken down into shorter

sub goals that lead up to that big

moment

first you might help the king get his

stolen jewelry back then you help a

wizard with his potion problem etc

whenever we finish something no matter

how mundane or small it might seem

we get rewarded with his sense of

accomplishment and the more we feel

accomplished

the more we want to continue feeling

that way essentially this creates a loop

where a tiny bit of success rewards us

with dopamine and motivation to continue

which results into more success sure we

might have not killed the dragon yet but

we've still completed something that's

leading in that direction

and that's all that matters since as

long as we continue doing that

eventually that big goal will be

achieved if you want to write a book for

example

your sub-goals might look something like

this create a chapter outline

design a book cover write 1000 words

edit one page of course all of these can

be broken down even further but i think

you get the general idea

the point is to kickstart the

achievement loop and do something that

will lead you towards the greater

objective

now goals are also important because of

the second key element that video games

have

which is that progress is visible games

make it very clear that you're improving

by showing you that the experience bar

is getting filled up

however it never says you're 0.7 percent

on your way to level 100

that would be the motivating instead it

shows you that you're 70

towards level 2. this visible progress

gives you the necessary motivation to

continue grinding forward

it's very easy to justify playing a

little longer just so you can reach that

next level before logging out

but the thing is that usually there are

multiple progress bars getting filled up

at the same time so that by the time you

reach level 3 in one skill

you're almost level 5 in another and

when you reach that level 5 you're now

close to level 4 in the other one

so you're made aware that you're

constantly close to completing something

which makes you want to keep on playing

however progress in real life is usually

not that obvious

and you must make it visible yourself

i've found that one of the best ways to

do that

is by simply tracking your daily

activities during each day make sure to

take note of all the things you've done

that led you towards your goals

if you wrote 500 words for your book

write it down

if you ran three miles for your training

write it down

if you studied for one hour write it

down and if you save ten dollars by

escaping starbucks

write it down this way you make your

progress

or lack of it actually visible somewhere

and you can clearly see for getting

closer to your goals or sub goals

and when you see that you're close to

accomplishing one of them you'll be more

motivated to continue moving forward

just so you can reach that milestone now

knowing that you're progressing

is also important because of the third

key element which is that games reward

you for your effort

there is often some sort of prize when

you reach a certain level or complete a

quest

and these rewards serve as an incentive

to complete your tasks

would you bother killing a dragon if you

didn't get anything for it

probably not but because there is a

prize you keep completing those quests

rewards are often one of the best

motivators in real life as well as when

you anticipate getting one

your brain makes sure to release a lot

of dopamine

in the back of your mind you know that

once you finish let's say

studying for example you get to enjoy a

reward of your

choice without any guilt which can

easily make you power through your task

but it has to be noted that in video

games the reward always rewards you back

in some way

once you defeat an enemy you might get a

stronger sword which means you cannot

defeat bigger enemies

essentially the prize you receive makes

the game play better for you

and it makes you want to continue

playing and this is something that a lot

of us get wrong

when we eat healthy for one week

straight and we go to the gym

five times during that period sure we

deserve a reward

but instead of having a reward that

rewards us back we usually do something

that hurts the progress we've made

we reward ourselves by eating the whole

cake while laying on the couch

which if you think about it isn't a

smart move

imagine completing a quest in the game

and instead of gaining a level you get

penalized and your stats get worse

it doesn't happen yet in real life we

often do just that

we manage to save 500 and what do we do

we reward ourselves with a brand new

phone which we don't really need

or something of that nature instead we

should invest that money into an asset

that will reward us back

that will allow us to make and save even

more money in the future

or for another example if you like

running like me

you could reward your consistency with

new running shoes

that kind of reward makes the runs

easier and it reinforces the habit

so think about your own life situation

and find the reward that rewards you

back

or at least make sure it doesn't

sabotage your progress like it usually

does

but you might notice that the rewards in

games aren't always the same

you don't always get a better sword but

instead you sometimes get a stronger

armor

other times it's a new spell etc which

brings me to the fourth key game element

variety and novelty good games always

have something new waiting for us

it could be new area unlocks new enemies

or just new cosmetics

our brains love variety and as long as

an activity has something novel to

stimulate us

it remains attractive and satisfying

imagine if instead of experiencing

something new in the game you would have

to repeat the same level over and over

most of us wouldn't find it fun we would

get bored of doing the same thing pretty

quickly

and we would want to quit and it's the

same in our daily lives

if we want to stick to something long

term it helps if we can incorporate

something new into the activity

if you have a job think back on the

first day you spent there

the job probably didn't feel boring

instead it was most likely interesting

there were so many new people to meet

and a lot of things to learn

however one year later once all that

novelty has faded the job probably

became boring and

dull that's because it became routine

and now there's nothing new to

experience

it's kinda like repeating the same level

in a game for 8 hours a day

5 days a week you don't really have

anything to look forward to since you

already know what to expect

while i do encourage having some sort of

a routine in your life

it's also good if you have some

variation within that routine

so if you usually do the same work all

the time see if it's possible to take on

a different project to switch it up a

little bit

preferably something that you're not

fully familiar with so the challenge is

novel

now while you might not be able to have

a direct impact on the way you do things

at your job

you can always incorporate some new

aspects that are still related to it

which you do have control over like

befriending someone at the office who

you don't normally interact with

maybe reorganizing your desk or just

going to a different restaurant to eat

your lunch

as you can see it doesn't have to be a

massive change nor does it have to be

permanent

the point is to just have a new

experience every once in a while

you can also spice up your workout

routine by trying out a new exercise

or if you're still studying for school

try to find a different study location

just look for a way to make your days

slightly different

now the fifth and final key element that

games have is that they consistently

challenge you

the human brain loves working on and

overcoming obstacles

but the difficulty has to match your

current skill level otherwise you won't

enjoy them

nor will you want to do them in other

words the challenge must be neither too

hard

nor too easy when you start at level 1

you don't go fighting the biggest and

the baddest boss right away

you would get defeated every time as it

would be too difficult for your skill

level

and because it would be too hard you

wouldn't want to continue playing

this is why games set you up against

easier challenges first

those that you're able to actually

overcome but once you get better at the

game the difficulty also ramps up

otherwise if you were to improve but the

challenge stayed the same you wouldn't

want to continue playing

there is no fun if you're able to just

effortlessly demolish everything in your

way

you would quickly get bored because the

game would be too easy

the challenge has to feel at least

semi-difficult so that when you overcome

it you can actually feel proud about it

and get rewarded by that sweet

sweet dopamine but in real life we are

only rarely faced with optimal

challenges

instead most of the time we're either

overwhelmed or bored by them

if something feels overwhelming and you

can't bring yourself to do it chances

are that it's above your current skill

level

you need to take a step back and start

slow at the beginning

break that big task down into more

manageable pieces

then you should tackle those pieces

individually and focus on the easiest

one first

this helps bring the difficulty down and

get the momentum going at the same time

if something feels too easy you must

increase the challenge

ideally you would want to skip the easy

tasks but sometimes they just have to

get done

personally i increase their difficulty

by imposing time limits on them

i give myself a time frame and try to do

the task before the time runs out

this forces me to find a way to be more

efficient which also helps me get

through it faster in the future

i'm still doing the same boring activity

but the time pressure ramps up the

difficulty

and makes it more fun so try to match

the difficulty to your skill level

you will find that whenever you're able

to do so you will be more engaged and

the activity will be more compelling

by now you probably have a much better

understanding about what makes video

games so addictive

and you might notice that if those

elements are not present the game

doesn't really pull us in as much

of course there can also be other

factors that make games irresistible

not just the five i've described one for

example could be the social aspect that

provides a sense of community and

competition

another one might be cool background

music that we enjoy

or the game could provide us with

feelings of autonomy and a sense of

control

however i didn't want to focus on every

single factor because i wanted to

prioritize the most prevalent ones

found in rpgs since those games resemble

our lives the most

now it also has to be noted that video

games apply all those elements at an

extremely rapid rate

making the release of dopamine very

frequent so

frequent in fact that our daily

activities aren't actually able to match

it

but that doesn't mean you shouldn't

replicate the dopamine trail

in fact it's even more important that

you implement it otherwise you'll just

get pulled towards wherever the most

dopamine is

so make sure to apply those five

elements to the areas of your life that

you find most important

this will allow you to take control of

the carrot and you'll be able to do

whatever you set out to do if you made

it this far into the video

let me just say that you're awesome and

i would highly appreciate it if you

would gently tap that like button below

the video

this shows the youtube algorithm that

ideas like these are worth spreading and

it shows my content to more people

which means more people can benefit from

it and improve their lives

as always thanks for watching and i hope

i made you better

than yesterday

do you accept this quest your job is to

apply

all five elements to one daily activity

yes i accept it then i wish you the best

of luck on your journey hero

[Music]

you
