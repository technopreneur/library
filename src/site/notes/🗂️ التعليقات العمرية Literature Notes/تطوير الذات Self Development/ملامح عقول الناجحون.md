التاريخ: 2022-12-04 08:44

#### 1) Personal fulfillment 
Dark horses are people who prioritize personal fulfillment over conventional notions of success such as universal things like competition, money, collaboration.

#### 2) Optimize Choice
Dark horses are really fantastic at realizing you actually do have a lot of choice every day, if you're looking for it.

#### Multiple Strategies
For anything that you ever want to accomplish, there's always multiple ways to accomplish it.

#### 3) Ignore the Destination
The final element of a dark horse mindset is ignoring the destination. It takes the focus off of something you should be focusing on

#### 4) Door to Success
It's sort of like getting into a nightclub. So there's always three ways in: There's the first door, the main entrance, And then there's the second door, the VIP entrance, and there's always, always 'the third door.'

#### 5) Design for the Future
Pessimists never win wars; only optimists win wars. Act for the Future.
