There are many types of journals, but my interpretation is that you will need one in light of the Zettlekasten method

1) Diary = Daily Note, a record of experiences and feelings.
2) Journal = Self Fleeting Note
3) Commonplace Book = Fleeting Note with external material
4) Compendiums = Literature Notes
5) Book of Soliloquies = Permanent Notes
6) Collection of Best Ideas = A Fleeting Note
7) Pocket Notebook = A Daily Note
